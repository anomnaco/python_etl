Many founders we talk to believe the terms are interchangeable—simply two different ways to describe the same function… right? Not quite. Today, we’re talking <strong>business development vs sales</strong>.</p><p>Let’s start by clearly defining both <strong>business development and sales</strong>. Then, we’ll dig deeper into the differences, how they support each other, and which function needs to be your focus based on the stage your company is at today.</p><p><strong>Want to take your sales game to a new level?

It’s the act of generating well-researched, qualified leads to hand off to your sales team. <strong>Business development is all about generating leads</strong>, and the job titles most often associated with business development are roles like, Business Development Rep (BDR) or Sales Development Rep (SDR).</p><p>Sales comes second, and is wholly concerned with <a href="https://blog.close.com/close-sale" rel="noopener" target="_blank">closing a winning deal</a> with the qualified prospects that come from your organization’s business development activities. <strong>Sales is all about transactions.</strong> Titles for sales roles vary widely, but typically form around phrases like Sales Representative, Account Manager or Account Executive.\xa0</p><p>Moreover, when you’re <a href="https://blog.close.com/sales-management-new-managers-guide-to-building-a-sales-team" rel="noopener" target="_blank">building a sales team</a> from the ground up, it can be difficult to decide which role (business development vs sales) you should hire first—or to bring on more of in the early days.</p><p>The answer, as with most things in business, is… well, <em>it depends</em>.</p><p>Now that you’ve got a clear definition of the difference between business development and sales, start by first asking yourself which one sounds like a higher priority within your organization right now. Which role do you truly need today?\xa0</p><p>If you’ve gotten clear market validation for your solution and are consistently closing a high proportion of the prospects you speak with, but just need a higher volume of leads to continue flowing through your pipeline, then hiring a business development rep and training them on how to prospect for the right leads should be your number one priority.</p><p>If you have more qualified inbound leads than you know what to do with, but you simply don’t have enough time to follow up with every lead, schedule a meeting, do a demo and close the deal, then your focus should be on getting more sales reps on board who can help close more of your hot leads.</p><p>Sounds pretty straightforward, but the reality is that it can take a while to get to this stage.</p><p>In the earlier phases of your business (or before acquiring funding as a startup), it’s natural for founders and other members of the team to take on both business development and sales-related responsibilities while resources are constrained before <a href="https://blog.close.com/sales-hiring-101-for-startups">sales hiring</a> becomes a viable option.</p><p>As long as the founder-driven sales stage is working well and your revenue is growing, that’s ok for a while.\xa0</p><p>Over time though, the separation of the two roles should become more pronounced and specialized as your business begins to scale and you can afford to invest in better solving your bigger problem—generating more leads or bringing on salespeople to close more of the leads you already have.</p><h2><strong>Why you need to separate business development and sales</strong></h2><p>Let’s examine a few of the critical reasons why your business stands to benefit immensely by separating the roles of business development and sales.</p><h3><strong>Creating domain expertise in your organization</strong></h3><p>Since the advent of the world’s first automobile manufacturing lines in the early 1900’s, <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/specialization.asp" rel="noopener" target="_blank">labor specialization</a> has proliferated into countless other industries with massively positive effects.</p><p><strong>Division of labor:</strong> Known as the separation of tasks within any system, the primary goal of clearly dividing tasks within your sales team, is to allow individuals to specialize within their roles.</p><p>Anyone who spends the majority of their day executing the same sets of tasks (that ladder up to a very clear goal) is likely going to build expertise much quicker than their counterparts who spend the day task-switching between multiple different roles and goals.\xa0</p><p>Separating business development and sales within your organization is no exception. When you allow members of your sales team to focus solely on either prospecting or closing, they’ll develop a level of expertise at their role that’s otherwise very difficult to achieve.</p><p>Instead of splitting their time (and mental capacity), or task-switching throughout their entire day, your business development reps are able to focus on doing everything they can to bring more qualified prospects into the company’s pipeline. Conversely, your sales reps are empowered to work on nothing but the key activities in <a href="https://blog.close.com/how-to-build-a-sales-process-that-gets-results" rel="noopener" target="_blank">your sales process</a> that are proven to close more deals and generate transactions.\xa0</p><p>Creating an environment that accelerates the development of expertise is priceless in terms of organizational benefits—you’ll be able to generate more leads <em>and</em> close more of them.</p><h3><strong>Individual productivity gains</strong></h3><p>We touched on this briefly in the context of rapidly building expertise within your sales organization as a result of separating business development and sales, but it’s worth highlighting the productivity gains your team will experience at the individual level too.</p><p>When you have salespeople that are also doing their own prospecting (researching, qualifying, initial outreach), their calendars can quickly fill up with a myriad of different activities like conducting research, <a href="https://blog.close.com/b2b-cold-calling-tips" rel="noopener" target="_blank">cold calling</a> from a list of inbound leads and <a href="https://blog.close.com/5-cold-email-templates-that-will-generate-warm-leads-for-your-sales-team" rel="noopener" target="_blank">sending cold emails</a> to prospects.

On top of that, studies <a href="http://www.apa.org/research/action/multitask.aspx" rel="noopener" target="_blank">have shown</a> the quality of your work declines dramatically the more frequently you switch between tasks.</p><p>Psychologist <a href="https://lsa.umich.edu/psych/people/faculty/demeyer.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">David Meyer, PhD</a>, director of the University of Michigan\'s Brain, Cognition, and Action Laboratory explains, “Although switching costs may be relatively small, sometimes just a few tenths of a second per switch, they can add up to large amounts when people switch repeatedly back and forth between tasks. Thus, multitasking may seem efficient on the surface, but may actually take more time in the end and involve more error.”\xa0</p><p>Meyer reports that even brief mental blocks created by shifting between tasks <strong>can cost as much as 40%</strong> of someone\'s productive time in a given day—time that you can’t afford to lose in a startup or SMB.</p><p>When you separate the responsibilities of business development and sales within your organization, you’re grouping similar activities together and making individuals responsible for a limited set of goals that are directly impacted by the activities they’re expected to do on a daily basis (having a clear connection to impact being <a href="https://open.buffer.com/meaningful-work/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">one of the three things</a> that make work most meaningful).</p><p>That elimination of multiple different types of goals allows members of your sales team to work on fewer tasks—thus empowering them to execute on single tasks for focused blocks of time.

They’re responsible for bringing in enough qualified leads to generate a certain amount of revenue, but actually <a href="https://blog.close.com/close-sale" rel="noopener" target="_blank">closing the sale</a> and turning leads into customers is beyond their direct control.</p><p><strong>So, what’s changed in the world of business development?</strong></p><p>It’s become increasingly difficult to reach decision-makers and to engage them the way they want, when they want. Hell, I can’t even remember the last time I answered a call from a number I didn’t recognize—let alone respond to unsolicited sales emails.\xa0</p><p>The proliferation of conversational sales and marketing tools like <a href="https://www.drift.com/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Drift</a> are proof of this dramatic shift. Your customers time is valuable, and giving them the ability to control when and how they interact with you is a serious experience upgrade, therefore your <a href="https://blog.close.com/create-sales-plan" rel="noopener" target="_blank">sales plan</a> needs to grow and adapt with this shift.\xa0</p><p>Beyond just better managing the experience of your inbound leads, it also takes more time to adequately research prospects, and requires more touch points on a lead in order to capture their attention.</p><p>Business development is more about relationship-building than ever, making it a standalone full-time position on any sales team.</p><p>At the end of the day, it’s not a smart investment to have someone responsible for a new deal quota, shifting gears between prospecting, demoing and closing within their work day.</p><h2><strong>How business development and sales work together (4 common questions)</strong></h2><p>Now that we’re clear about the separation between business development vs sales, let’s talk about how the two roles should best work collaboratively together, for maximum effectiveness on your sales team.</p><h3><strong>1. When should business development pass a lead on to sales?</strong></h3><p>Your sales team has quotas they need to hit, which means they can’t waste time talking to prospects that aren’t already <a href="https://blog.close.com/qualify" rel="noopener" target="_blank">well-qualified.</a> Otherwise, they\'ll be wasting time and energy chasing the wrong leads and diluting their close rate.</p><p>Business development reps should pass a lead on to sales <strong>as soon as they’re qualified</strong>. However, that doesn’t mean business development teams and sales teams shouldn’t have a collaborative work relationship.</p><p><a href="https://www.wework.com/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">WeWork</a> VP of Business Development, <a href="http://startofthedeal.com/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Scott Pollack</a> explains, “business development teams should be identifying, evaluating, and pursuing opportunities to create long-term value for a company. This means BD teams and sales teams should happily coexist—the sales team gets to work on closing opportunities that can drive revenue <em>today</em>, while the BD team focuses their attention on opportunities to open new channels and drive a flood of new leads for tomorrow.”</p><p>As Pollack suggests, it’s incredibly important that business development teams focus their time, effort and energy on building relationships only with the most qualified leads that stand a chance of becoming happy customers. Then, they’re worthy of being handed off to sales.</p><p>How do you know when a lead is fully qualified and ready to be closed? That can vary a bit based on the type of product you’re selling and the market you’re serving, but starting with choosing from these <a href="https://resources.close.com/qualifying-questions" rel="noopener" target="_blank">42 B2B qualifying questions</a> to ask your prospects won’t hurt.\xa0</p><p>In order to qualify your prospects, you’ll want to accurately gauge how well they match your <a href="https://sixteenventures.com/ideal-customer-profile" rel="noopener" target="_blank">ideal customer profile</a> with key information around company size, location and industry.\xa0</p><p>Next, you want to assess their needs to make sure there’s a true use case for your product, develop an understanding of their purchasing process to make sure it’s a match with your selling process, and assess other competitive options they may be considering.</p><p>If everything checks out and the prospect still appears to be a strong potential customer, then they’re qualified—and ready to be closed by your sales team.</p><h3><strong>2. Should there be overlap between business development and sales?</strong></h3><p>In terms of day-to-day activities? <strong>No, not really</strong>.</p><p>Business development should be wholly tasked with prospecting and qualifying. Sales should be focused only on closing those qualified leads and generating transactions.</p><p>However, your business development reps and sales reps <em>do</em> need to be on the same page about who your ideal customers are—their characteristics, qualities and the kinds of problems your offering can best help them with.</p><p>Due to the rapidly changing environment in startups, this requires frequent cross-team collaboration.</p><p>As <a href="https://www.creativelive.com/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">CreativeLive</a> Director of Partnerships and Business Development, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/kimberlyannmurphy/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Kimberly Pousman</a> explains, “there not only <em>should be</em> overlap between business development and sales, but there <em>needs to be</em> overlap, whether you personally want it or not.”\xa0</p><p>Pousman continues, “One of the keys to being great in either a business development or sales role, is asking the right questions. When you’re looking to grow and expand, you need to ask the right questions, experiment and actively source feedback from others—so if your teams are operating in a silo, they’ll miss out on valuable opportunities to learn from each other and advance your growth rate.”</p><p>Furthermore, the downstream effect is that if this alignment between business development and sales teams isn’t up to par, your sales reps are going to have a difficult time closing enough deals with the leads they’ve got, which leads to frustration and a close rate below the <a href="https://www.pointclear.com/blog/what-should-the-sales-close-rate-be" rel="noopener" target="_blank">20-30% industry average</a> for SaaS.</p><p>If your sales team’s close rate is below 20%, they’re either not closing as well as they should, or your leads aren’t qualified enough.</p><h3><strong>3. What’s the difference in the day-to-day activities of business development reps and sales reps?</strong></h3><p>While the responsibilities of a business development rep can vary a bit based on the unique needs and internal demands of an organization, in general they’re responsible for two main tasks that sit at the core of this role:</p><ul><li><strong>Managing inbound leads:</strong> This translates into working through an internal list, <a href="https://blog.close.com/qualify" rel="noopener" target="_blank">qualifying leads</a> from various marketing campaigns and classifying the right ones as sales opportunities to be passed on to the sales team for further vetting and closing.</li>\n<li><strong>Leading outbound prospecting:</strong> On the flip side, this kind of outreach involves researching and contacting potential customers that haven’t proactively expressed interest in your product through cold calls and cold emails—with the goal of qualifying sales opportunities for your sales team.\xa0</li>\n</ul><p>On the inbound side of things, business development reps sit metaphorically between marketing and sales, filtering marketing leads and qualifying them before assigning them to the right sales rep that can move on to <a href="https://blog.close.com/close-sale" rel="noopener" target="_blank">close the sale</a>.</p><p>When it comes to outbound, business development reps need to first go through your organization’s <a href="https://blog.close.com/unstoppable-sales-team" rel="noopener" target="_blank">sales training</a> process so that they have a clear picture of who your ideal customers are before they go out and begin starting conversations with prospects. Depending upon the size of your company, your business development reps may or may not start with the beginning task of researching prospects before sending an email or calling.</p><p>Ultimately though, the goal of any outbound business development work is to start a conversation and <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/samanthaharrington/2017/05/26/how-to-create-strong-sales-relationships/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">develop a relationship</a> that can be passed on to sales for closing. Everything a business development rep does, should revolve around finding more prospects, qualifying the right ones and routing them to your sales team for closing.</p><p><strong>Now, let’s talk about the responsibilities of sales reps.</strong></p><p>Keeping in mind slight differences to match your unique internal needs, most sales representatives are charged with the following main responsibilities:</p><ul><li><strong>Selling:</strong> Closing deals (ideally with pre-qualified leads from your business development team to save time) using solid arguments and <a href="https://blog.close.com/10-objection-handling-techniques-every-b2b-salesperson-should-know" rel="noopener" target="_blank">objection management</a> with prospective customers.</li>\n<li><strong>Maintaining relationships:</strong> Although a prospect might not be a fit to purchase your product or service today, that doesn’t mean they won’t be in a completely different position 6 months or a year from now—so keeping in touch with leads to encourage future sales is a major part of a sales rep’s responsibilities.</li>\n</ul><p>Most sales representative roles work against a <a href="https://blog.close.com/end-of-year-sales" rel="noopener" target="_blank">sales quota</a>—a thoughtfully calculated monthly or quarterly minimum for the number of customers (or revenue figure) they’re responsible to close. Sales reps are often incentivized with increasing levels of bonus payouts for hitting and exceeding quota within a given period.</p><p>The intense focus on hitting specific customer or revenue benchmarks each quarter is very intentionally designed to encourage sales reps to spend all of their time only on revenue-driving activities. More meetings. More product demos. More sales calls with qualified leads. More contracts sent out for approval. More <a href="https://blog.close.com/follow-up" rel="noopener" target="_blank">follow up emails</a> delivered.</p><p>In a mature sales organization, that means sales reps are empowered to spend less (or zero) time researching prospects, qualifying leads, and booking meetings. Those are activities a business development rep should be helping out with.</p><h3><strong>4. How does a business development call (or email) differ from that of a sales rep?</strong></h3><p>The biggest difference between the calls and emails that business development reps send vs those of a sales rep, is that most business development activities are done toward either completely or relatively <em>cold</em> prospects—meaning that these prospects have likely had little to no interaction with the company before this initial contact is made.\xa0</p><p>That’s when brushing up on your <a href="https://blog.close.com/5-cold-email-templates-that-will-generate-warm-leads-for-your-sales-team" rel="noopener" target="_blank">cold emails</a> and <a href="https://blog.close.com/b2b-cold-calling-tips" rel="noopener" target="_blank">cold calling</a> skills come into play.</p><p>By the time a sales rep is brought on to an account, the relationship has already been established and the lead is qualified, making the communications much more <em>warm</em> than those of a business development rep.

Many founders we talk to believe the terms are interchangeable—simply two different ways to describe the same function… right? Not quite. Today, we’re talking business development vs sales . Let’s start by clearly defining both business development and sales . Then, we’ll dig deeper into the differences, how they support each other, and which function needs to be your focus based on the stage your company is at today. Want to take your sales game to a new level? Get free access to our ultimate sales resource library today. ACCESS THE COMPLETE SALES LIBRARY NOW What is business development? The definition of business development is generating qualified new leads. The purpose of business development (in the context of a sales team—NOT in terms of product validation) is to research, prospect and create a pipeline of targeted potential customers to pass off to sales for further vetting and closing. What is sales? The definition of sales is generating transactions. The sole focus of a mature sales team is to close deals with the qualified leads that are coming from either your business development efforts or other lead generation strategies that are designed to start conversations with the right potential customers. So… what’s the difference between business development and sales? Put simply, business development comes first. It’s the act of generating well-researched, qualified leads to hand off to your sales team. Business development is all about generating leads , and the job titles most often associated with business development are roles like, Business Development Rep (BDR) or Sales Development Rep (SDR). Sales comes second, and is wholly concerned with closing a winning deal with the qualified prospects that come from your organization’s business development activities. Sales is all about transactions. Titles for sales roles vary widely, but typically form around phrases like Sales Representative, Account Manager or Account Executive. Moreover, when you’re building a sales team from the ground up, it can be difficult to decide which role (business development vs sales) you should hire first—or to bring on more of in the early days. The answer, as with most things in business, is… well, it depends . Now that you’ve got a clear definition of the difference between business development and sales, start by first asking yourself which one sounds like a higher priority within your organization right now. Which role do you truly need today? If you’ve gotten clear market validation for your solution and are consistently closing a high proportion of the prospects you speak with, but just need a higher volume of leads to continue flowing through your pipeline, then hiring a business development rep and training them on how to prospect for the right leads should be your number one priority. If you have more qualified inbound leads than you know what to do with, but you simply don’t have enough time to follow up with every lead, schedule a meeting, do a demo and close the deal, then your focus should be on getting more sales reps on board who can help close more of your hot leads. Sounds pretty straightforward, but the reality is that it can take a while to get to this stage. In the earlier phases of your business (or before acquiring funding as a startup), it’s natural for founders and other members of the team to take on both business development and sales-related responsibilities while resources are constrained before sales hiring becomes a viable option. As long as the founder-driven sales stage is working well and your revenue is growing, that’s ok for a while. Over time though, the separation of the two roles should become more pronounced and specialized as your business begins to scale and you can afford to invest in better solving your bigger problem—generating more leads or bringing on salespeople to close more of the leads you already have. Why you need to separate business development and sales Let’s examine a few of the critical reasons why your business stands to benefit immensely by separating the roles of business development and sales. Creating domain expertise in your organization Since the advent of the world’s first automobile manufacturing lines in the early 1900’s, labor specialization has proliferated into countless other industries with massively positive effects. Division of labor: Known as the separation of tasks within any system, the primary goal of clearly dividing tasks within your sales team, is to allow individuals to specialize within their roles. Anyone who spends the majority of their day executing the same sets of tasks (that ladder up to a very clear goal) is likely going to build expertise much quicker than their counterparts who spend the day task-switching between multiple different roles and goals. Separating business development and sales within your organization is no exception. When you allow members of your sales team to focus solely on either prospecting or closing, they’ll develop a level of expertise at their role that’s otherwise very difficult to achieve. Instead of splitting their time (and mental capacity), or task-switching throughout their entire day, your business development reps are able to focus on doing everything they can to bring more qualified prospects into the company’s pipeline. Conversely, your sales reps are empowered to work on nothing but the key activities in your sales process that are proven to close more deals and generate transactions. Creating an environment that accelerates the development of expertise is priceless in terms of organizational benefits—you’ll be able to generate more leads and close more of them. Individual productivity gains We touched on this briefly in the context of rapidly building expertise within your sales organization as a result of separating business development and sales, but it’s worth highlighting the productivity gains your team will experience at the individual level too. When you have salespeople that are also doing their own prospecting (researching, qualifying, initial outreach), their calendars can quickly fill up with a myriad of different activities like conducting research, cold calling from a list of inbound leads and sending cold emails to prospects. Their calendars can quickly look like… Known as cognitive switching , the act of consciously switching from one task to another within your day can leave you mentally exhausted. On top of that, studies have shown the quality of your work declines dramatically the more frequently you switch between tasks. Psychologist David Meyer, PhD , director of the University of Michigan's Brain, Cognition, and Action Laboratory explains, “Although switching costs may be relatively small, sometimes just a few tenths of a second per switch, they can add up to large amounts when people switch repeatedly back and forth between tasks. Thus, multitasking may seem efficient on the surface, but may actually take more time in the end and involve more error.” Meyer reports that even brief mental blocks created by shifting between tasks can cost as much as 40% of someone's productive time in a given day—time that you can’t afford to lose in a startup or SMB. When you separate the responsibilities of business development and sales within your organization, you’re grouping similar activities together and making individuals responsible for a limited set of goals that are directly impacted by the activities they’re expected to do on a daily basis (having a clear connection to impact being one of the three things that make work most meaningful). That elimination of multiple different types of goals allows members of your sales team to work on fewer tasks—thus empowering them to execute on single tasks for focused blocks of time. Which allows their calendars to look much more like… The fewer objectives your individual contributors (both in business development and sales roles) are responsible for delivering against, the more they’ll be able to focus on excelling and being more productive on the limited tasks at hand. Business development requires more effort than it used to The core functions of business development haven’t changed much in recent years, but the process of prospecting and qualifying leads has become much more nuanced. Business development roles are still charged with two main responsibilities: Prospecting: Identifying companies and people that may be interested in purchasing your product or service  Qualifying: Determining if your prospect is ready, willing and able to buy  Once a lead is qualified and has a strong likelihood of converting into becoming a paying customer, they’re passed off to the sales team for closing (and if need be negotiating the terms of the contract). This means that business development reps do not ideally have quotas. They’re responsible for bringing in enough qualified leads to generate a certain amount of revenue, but actually closing the sale and turning leads into customers is beyond their direct control. So, what’s changed in the world of business development? It’s become increasingly difficult to reach decision-makers and to engage them the way they want, when they want. Hell, I can’t even remember the last time I answered a call from a number I didn’t recognize—let alone respond to unsolicited sales emails. The proliferation of conversational sales and marketing tools like Drift are proof of this dramatic shift. Your customers time is valuable, and giving them the ability to control when and how they interact with you is a serious experience upgrade, therefore your sales plan needs to grow and adapt with this shift. Beyond just better managing the experience of your inbound leads, it also takes more time to adequately research prospects, and requires more touch points on a lead in order to capture their attention. Business development is more about relationship-building than ever, making it a standalone full-time position on any sales team. At the end of the day, it’s not a smart investment to have someone responsible for a new deal quota, shifting gears between prospecting, demoing and closing within their work day. How business development and sales work together (4 common questions) Now that we’re clear about the separation between business development vs sales, let’s talk about how the two roles should best work collaboratively together, for maximum effectiveness on your sales team. 1. When should business development pass a lead on to sales? Your sales team has quotas they need to hit, which means they can’t waste time talking to prospects that aren’t already well-qualified. Otherwise, they'll be wasting time and energy chasing the wrong leads and diluting their close rate. Business development reps should pass a lead on to sales as soon as they’re qualified . However, that doesn’t mean business development teams and sales teams shouldn’t have a collaborative work relationship. WeWork VP of Business Development, Scott Pollack explains, “business development teams should be identifying, evaluating, and pursuing opportunities to create long-term value for a company. This means BD teams and sales teams should happily coexist—the sales team gets to work on closing opportunities that can drive revenue today , while the BD team focuses their attention on opportunities to open new channels and drive a flood of new leads for tomorrow.” As Pollack suggests, it’s incredibly important that business development teams focus their time, effort and energy on building relationships only with the most qualified leads that stand a chance of becoming happy customers. Then, they’re worthy of being handed off to sales. How do you know when a lead is fully qualified and ready to be closed? That can vary a bit based on the type of product you’re selling and the market you’re serving, but starting with choosing from these 42 B2B qualifying questions to ask your prospects won’t hurt. In order to qualify your prospects, you’ll want to accurately gauge how well they match your ideal customer profile with key information around company size, location and industry. Next, you want to assess their needs to make sure there’s a true use case for your product, develop an understanding of their purchasing process to make sure it’s a match with your selling process, and assess other competitive options they may be considering. If everything checks out and the prospect still appears to be a strong potential customer, then they’re qualified—and ready to be closed by your sales team. 2. Should there be overlap between business development and sales? In terms of day-to-day activities? No, not really . Business development should be wholly tasked with prospecting and qualifying. Sales should be focused only on closing those qualified leads and generating transactions. However, your business development reps and sales reps do need to be on the same page about who your ideal customers are—their characteristics, qualities and the kinds of problems your offering can best help them with. Due to the rapidly changing environment in startups, this requires frequent cross-team collaboration. As CreativeLive Director of Partnerships and Business Development, Kimberly Pousman explains, “there not only should be overlap between business development and sales, but there needs to be overlap, whether you personally want it or not.” Pousman continues, “One of the keys to being great in either a business development or sales role, is asking the right questions. When you’re looking to grow and expand, you need to ask the right questions, experiment and actively source feedback from others—so if your teams are operating in a silo, they’ll miss out on valuable opportunities to learn from each other and advance your growth rate.” Furthermore, the downstream effect is that if this alignment between business development and sales teams isn’t up to par, your sales reps are going to have a difficult time closing enough deals with the leads they’ve got, which leads to frustration and a close rate below the 20-30% industry average for SaaS. If your sales team’s close rate is below 20%, they’re either not closing as well as they should, or your leads aren’t qualified enough. 3. What’s the difference in the day-to-day activities of business development reps and sales reps? While the responsibilities of a business development rep can vary a bit based on the unique needs and internal demands of an organization, in general they’re responsible for two main tasks that sit at the core of this role: Managing inbound leads: This translates into working through an internal list, qualifying leads from various marketing campaigns and classifying the right ones as sales opportunities to be passed on to the sales team for further vetting and closing.  Leading outbound prospecting: On the flip side, this kind of outreach involves researching and contacting potential customers that haven’t proactively expressed interest in your product through cold calls and cold emails—with the goal of qualifying sales opportunities for your sales team.  On the inbound side of things, business development reps sit metaphorically between marketing and sales, filtering marketing leads and qualifying them before assigning them to the right sales rep that can move on to close the sale . When it comes to outbound, business development reps need to first go through your organization’s sales training process so that they have a clear picture of who your ideal customers are before they go out and begin starting conversations with prospects. Depending upon the size of your company, your business development reps may or may not start with the beginning task of researching prospects before sending an email or calling. Ultimately though, the goal of any outbound business development work is to start a conversation and develop a relationship that can be passed on to sales for closing. Everything a business development rep does, should revolve around finding more prospects, qualifying the right ones and routing them to your sales team for closing. Now, let’s talk about the responsibilities of sales reps. Keeping in mind slight differences to match your unique internal needs, most sales representatives are charged with the following main responsibilities: Selling: Closing deals (ideally with pre-qualified leads from your business development team to save time) using solid arguments and objection management with prospective customers.  Maintaining relationships: Although a prospect might not be a fit to purchase your product or service today, that doesn’t mean they won’t be in a completely different position 6 months or a year from now—so keeping in touch with leads to encourage future sales is a major part of a sales rep’s responsibilities.  Most sales representative roles work against a sales quota —a thoughtfully calculated monthly or quarterly minimum for the number of customers (or revenue figure) they’re responsible to close. Sales reps are often incentivized with increasing levels of bonus payouts for hitting and exceeding quota within a given period. The intense focus on hitting specific customer or revenue benchmarks each quarter is very intentionally designed to encourage sales reps to spend all of their time only on revenue-driving activities. More meetings. More product demos. More sales calls with qualified leads. More contracts sent out for approval. More follow up emails delivered. In a mature sales organization, that means sales reps are empowered to spend less (or zero) time researching prospects, qualifying leads, and booking meetings. Those are activities a business development rep should be helping out with. 4. How does a business development call (or email) differ from that of a sales rep? The biggest difference between the calls and emails that business development reps send vs those of a sales rep, is that most business development activities are done toward either completely or relatively cold prospects—meaning that these prospects have likely had little to no interaction with the company before this initial contact is made. That’s when brushing up on your cold emails and cold calling skills come into play. By the time a sales rep is brought on to an account, the relationship has already been established and the lead is qualified, making the communications much more warm than those of a business development rep. The conversation with a sales rep is about how to make a mutually beneficial deal happen, rather than gauging the initial interest or need. Bonus: The key traits you need to look for in every business development (and sales) hire Bringing the right business development and salespeople onto your sales team is crucial in making meaningful progress toward growing your business. If your candidates don’t exhibit these key traits, our advice is to keep searching for the right people that will have a positive impact on your team. Communication and people skills If you hope to cultivate strong relationships with prospects and customers alike, having strong communication and people skills—like the ability to lead a friendly negotiation from start to finish so that the new customers you bring on are pleased with their decision, is crucial. Navigating the process of converting a lead into a paying customer requires the ability to empathize; to fully understand your prospect’s situation and the use case they’ll have for your product to make sure that they’ll truly benefit from your offering. Hunger and drive The most successful salespeople (and business development reps) have an internal drive that pushes them forward and propels them to achieve their sales goals. In the face of a challenge, they’re not discouraged—rather, they look forward to the opportunity to excel, surpass previous expectations and move up to the next level. They’re often incentivized by the prospect of earning more money , and respond well to financial rewards for performance improvements. Discipline and confidence Discipline and the confidence in your process beats motivation every single day of the week when you’ve just gotten ten rejections in a row. No matter how skilled or experience you are, in sales there will be moments of defeat that can drain your motivation levels. The best salespeople know that sales is a numbers game, and that the only way to recover from rejection & failure is to pick up the phone (or get back into your email) and keep executing. Having the right tools and systems, like our Power Dialer will also help keep your team on track and reaching peak productivity levels each day. They’re consultants at heart Just because a salesperson has mastered every tactic in the book and can sell ice to an eskimo doesn’t mean they’re going to bring in customers that’ll still be happy with their purchase decision one, three, six months down the line. When hiring a business development or sales rep, look for people that view their role as partnering with prospects to make sure there’s a mutual win-win in each potential deal—ensuring that the customer has a genuine need for the product and that they’re actually a fit for your ideal customer persona of people and companies you want to serve in the first place.

When you’re looking to grow and expand, you need to ask the right questions, experiment and actively source feedback from others—so if your teams are operating in a silo, they’ll miss out on valuable opportunities to learn from each other and advance your growth rate.” Furthermore, the downstream effect is that if this alignment between business development and sales teams isn’t up to par, your sales reps are going to have a difficult time closing enough deals with the leads they’ve got, which leads to frustration and a close rate below the 20-30% industry average for SaaS. If your sales team’s close rate is below 20%, they’re either not closing as well as they should, or your leads aren’t qualified enough. 3. What’s the difference in the day-to-day activities of business development reps and sales reps? While the responsibilities of a business development rep can vary a bit based on the unique needs and internal demands of an organization, in general they’re responsible for two main tasks that sit at the core of this role: Managing inbound leads: This translates into working through an internal list, qualifying leads from various marketing campaigns and classifying the right ones as sales opportunities to be passed on to the sales team for further vetting and closing.  Leading outbound prospecting: On the flip side, this kind of outreach involves researching and contacting potential customers that haven’t proactively expressed interest in your product through cold calls and cold emails—with the goal of qualifying sales opportunities for your sales team.  On the inbound side of things, business development reps sit metaphorically between marketing and sales, filtering marketing leads and qualifying them before assigning them to the right sales rep that can move on to close the sale . When it comes to outbound, business development reps need to first go through your organization’s sales training process so that they have a clear picture of who your ideal customers are before they go out and begin starting conversations with prospects. Depending upon the size of your company, your business development reps may or may not start with the beginning task of researching prospects before sending an email or calling. Ultimately though, the goal of any outbound business development work is to start a conversation and develop a relationship that can be passed on to sales for closing. Everything a business development rep does, should revolve around finding more prospects, qualifying the right ones and routing them to your sales team for closing. Now, let’s talk about the responsibilities of sales reps. Keeping in mind slight differences to match your unique internal needs, most sales representatives are charged with the following main responsibilities: Selling: Closing deals (ideally with pre-qualified leads from your business development team to save time) using solid arguments and objection management with prospective customers.  Maintaining relationships: Although a prospect might not be a fit to purchase your product or service today, that doesn’t mean they won’t be in a completely different position 6 months or a year from now—so keeping in touch with leads to encourage future sales is a major part of a sales rep’s responsibilities.  Most sales representative roles work against a sales quota —a thoughtfully calculated monthly or quarterly minimum for the number of customers (or revenue figure) they’re responsible to close. Sales reps are often incentivized with increasing levels of bonus payouts for hitting and exceeding quota within a given period. The intense focus on hitting specific customer or revenue benchmarks each quarter is very intentionally designed to encourage sales reps to spend all of their time only on revenue-driving activities. More meetings. More product demos. More sales calls with qualified leads. More contracts sent out for approval. More follow up emails delivered. In a mature sales organization, that means sales reps are empowered to spend less (or zero) time researching prospects, qualifying leads, and booking meetings. Those are activities a business development rep should be helping out with. 4. How does a business development call (or email) differ from that of a sales rep? The biggest difference between the calls and emails that business development reps send vs those of a sales rep, is that most business development activities are done toward either completely or relatively cold prospects—meaning that these prospects have likely had little to no interaction with the company before this initial contact is made. That’s when brushing up on your cold emails and cold calling skills come into play. By the time a sales rep is brought on to an account, the relationship has already been established and the lead is qualified, making the communications much more warm than those of a business development rep. The conversation with a sales rep is about how to make a mutually beneficial deal happen, rather than gauging the initial interest or need. Bonus: The key traits you need to look for in every business development (and sales) hire Bringing the right business development and salespeople onto your sales team is crucial in making meaningful progress toward growing your business. If your candidates don’t exhibit these key traits, our advice is to keep searching for the right people that will have a positive impact on your team. Communication and people skills If you hope to cultivate strong relationships with prospects and customers alike, having strong communication and people skills—like the ability to lead a friendly negotiation from start to finish so that the new customers you bring on are pleased with their decision, is crucial. Navigating the process of converting a lead into a paying customer requires the ability to empathize; to fully understand your prospect’s situation and the use case they’ll have for your product to make sure that they’ll truly benefit from your offering. Hunger and drive The most successful salespeople (and business development reps) have an internal drive that pushes them forward and propels them to achieve their sales goals. In the face of a challenge, they’re not discouraged—rather, they look forward to the opportunity to excel, surpass previous expectations and move up to the next level. They’re often incentivized by the prospect of earning more money , and respond well to financial rewards for performance improvements. Discipline and confidence Discipline and the confidence in your process beats motivation every single day of the week when you’ve just gotten ten rejections in a row. No matter how skilled or experience you are, in sales there will be moments of defeat that can drain your motivation levels. The best salespeople know that sales is a numbers game, and that the only way to recover from rejection & failure is to pick up the phone (or get back into your email) and keep executing. Having the right tools and systems, like our Power Dialer will also help keep your team on track and reaching peak productivity levels each day. They’re consultants at heart Just because a salesperson has mastered every tactic in the book and can sell ice to an eskimo doesn’t mean they’re going to bring in customers that’ll still be happy with their purchase decision one, three, six months down the line. When hiring a business development or sales rep, look for people that view their role as partnering with prospects to make sure there’s a mutual win-win in each potential deal—ensuring that the customer has a genuine need for the product and that they’re actually a fit for your ideal customer persona of people and companies you want to serve in the first place.

Many founders we talk to believe the terms are interchangeable—simply two different ways to describe the same function… right? Not quite.

It’s the act of generating well-researched, qualified leads to hand off to your sales team. <strong>Business development is all about generating leads</strong>, and the job titles most often associated with business development are roles like, Business Development Rep (BDR) or Sales Development Rep (SDR).</p><p>Sales comes second, and is wholly concerned with <a href="https://blog.close.com/close-sale" rel="noopener" target="_blank">closing a winning deal</a> with the qualified prospects that come from your organization’s business development activities. <strong>Sales is all about transactions.</strong> Titles for sales roles vary widely, but typically form around phrases like Sales Representative, Account Manager or Account Executive.\xa0</p><p>Moreover, when you’re <a href="https://blog.close.com/sales-management-new-managers-guide-to-building-a-sales-team" rel="noopener" target="_blank">building a sales team</a> from the ground up, it can be difficult to decide which role (business development vs sales) you should hire first—or to bring on more of in the early days.</p><p>The answer, as with most things in business, is… well, <em>it depends</em>.</p><p>Now that you’ve got a clear definition of the difference between business development and sales, start by first asking yourself which one sounds like a higher priority within your organization right now. Which role do you truly need today?\xa0</p><p>If you’ve gotten clear market validation for your solution and are consistently closing a high proportion of the prospects you speak with, but just need a higher volume of leads to continue flowing through your pipeline, then hiring a business development rep and training them on how to prospect for the right leads should be your number one priority.</p><p>If you have more qualified inbound leads than you know what to do with, but you simply don’t have enough time to follow up with every lead, schedule a meeting, do a demo and close the deal, then your focus should be on getting more sales reps on board who can help close more of your hot leads.</p><p>Sounds pretty straightforward, but the reality is that it can take a while to get to this stage.</p><p>In the earlier phases of your business (or before acquiring funding as a startup), it’s natural for founders and other members of the team to take on both business development and sales-related responsibilities while resources are constrained before <a href="https://blog.close.com/sales-hiring-101-for-startups">sales hiring</a> becomes a viable option.</p><p>As long as the founder-driven sales stage is working well and your revenue is growing, that’s ok for a while.\xa0</p><p>Over time though, the separation of the two roles should become more pronounced and specialized as your business begins to scale and you can afford to invest in better solving your bigger problem—generating more leads or bringing on salespeople to close more of the leads you already have.</p><h2><strong>Why you need to separate business development and sales</strong></h2><p>Let’s examine a few of the critical reasons why your business stands to benefit immensely by separating the roles of business development and sales.</p><h3><strong>Creating domain expertise in your organization</strong></h3><p>Since the advent of the world’s first automobile manufacturing lines in the early 1900’s, <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/specialization.asp" rel="noopener" target="_blank">labor specialization</a> has proliferated into countless other industries with massively positive effects.</p><p><strong>Division of labor:</strong> Known as the separation of tasks within any system, the primary goal of clearly dividing tasks within your sales team, is to allow individuals to specialize within their roles.</p><p>Anyone who spends the majority of their day executing the same sets of tasks (that ladder up to a very clear goal) is likely going to build expertise much quicker than their counterparts who spend the day task-switching between multiple different roles and goals.\xa0</p><p>Separating business development and sales within your organization is no exception. When you allow members of your sales team to focus solely on either prospecting or closing, they’ll develop a level of expertise at their role that’s otherwise very difficult to achieve.</p><p>Instead of splitting their time (and mental capacity), or task-switching throughout their entire day, your business development reps are able to focus on doing everything they can to bring more qualified prospects into the company’s pipeline. Conversely, your sales reps are empowered to work on nothing but the key activities in <a href="https://blog.close.com/how-to-build-a-sales-process-that-gets-results" rel="noopener" target="_blank">your sales process</a> that are proven to close more deals and generate transactions.\xa0</p><p>Creating an environment that accelerates the development of expertise is priceless in terms of organizational benefits—you’ll be able to generate more leads <em>and</em> close more of them.</p><h3><strong>Individual productivity gains</strong></h3><p>We touched on this briefly in the context of rapidly building expertise within your sales organization as a result of separating business development and sales, but it’s worth highlighting the productivity gains your team will experience at the individual level too.</p><p>When you have salespeople that are also doing their own prospecting (researching, qualifying, initial outreach), their calendars can quickly fill up with a myriad of different activities like conducting research, <a href="https://blog.close.com/b2b-cold-calling-tips" rel="noopener" target="_blank">cold calling</a> from a list of inbound leads and <a href="https://blog.close.com/5-cold-email-templates-that-will-generate-warm-leads-for-your-sales-team" rel="noopener" target="_blank">sending cold emails</a> to prospects.

Thus, multitasking may seem efficient on the surface, but may actually take more time in the end and involve more error.”\xa0</p><p>Meyer reports that even brief mental blocks created by shifting between tasks <strong>can cost as much as 40%</strong> of someone\'s productive time in a given day—time that you can’t afford to lose in a startup or SMB.</p><p>When you separate the responsibilities of business development and sales within your organization, you’re grouping similar activities together and making individuals responsible for a limited set of goals that are directly impacted by the activities they’re expected to do on a daily basis (having a clear connection to impact being <a href="https://open.buffer.com/meaningful-work/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">one of the three things</a> that make work most meaningful).</p><p>That elimination of multiple different types of goals allows members of your sales team to work on fewer tasks—thus empowering them to execute on single tasks for focused blocks of time.

When should business development pass a lead on to sales?</strong></h3><p>Your sales team has quotas they need to hit, which means they can’t waste time talking to prospects that aren’t already <a href="https://blog.close.com/qualify" rel="noopener" target="_blank">well-qualified.</a> Otherwise, they\'ll be wasting time and energy chasing the wrong leads and diluting their close rate.</p><p>Business development reps should pass a lead on to sales <strong>as soon as they’re qualified</strong>. However, that doesn’t mean business development teams and sales teams shouldn’t have a collaborative work relationship.</p><p><a href="https://www.wework.com/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">WeWork</a> VP of Business Development, <a href="http://startofthedeal.com/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Scott Pollack</a> explains, “business development teams should be identifying, evaluating, and pursuing opportunities to create long-term value for a company. This means BD teams and sales teams should happily coexist—the sales team gets to work on closing opportunities that can drive revenue <em>today</em>, while the BD team focuses their attention on opportunities to open new channels and drive a flood of new leads for tomorrow.”</p><p>As Pollack suggests, it’s incredibly important that business development teams focus their time, effort and energy on building relationships only with the most qualified leads that stand a chance of becoming happy customers. Then, they’re worthy of being handed off to sales.</p><p>How do you know when a lead is fully qualified and ready to be closed? That can vary a bit based on the type of product you’re selling and the market you’re serving, but starting with choosing from these <a href="https://resources.close.com/qualifying-questions" rel="noopener" target="_blank">42 B2B qualifying questions</a> to ask your prospects won’t hurt.\xa0</p><p>In order to qualify your prospects, you’ll want to accurately gauge how well they match your <a href="https://sixteenventures.com/ideal-customer-profile" rel="noopener" target="_blank">ideal customer profile</a> with key information around company size, location and industry.\xa0</p><p>Next, you want to assess their needs to make sure there’s a true use case for your product, develop an understanding of their purchasing process to make sure it’s a match with your selling process, and assess other competitive options they may be considering.</p><p>If everything checks out and the prospect still appears to be a strong potential customer, then they’re qualified—and ready to be closed by your sales team.</p><h3><strong>2. Should there be overlap between business development and sales?</strong></h3><p>In terms of day-to-day activities? <strong>No, not really</strong>.</p><p>Business development should be wholly tasked with prospecting and qualifying. Sales should be focused only on closing those qualified leads and generating transactions.</p><p>However, your business development reps and sales reps <em>do</em> need to be on the same page about who your ideal customers are—their characteristics, qualities and the kinds of problems your offering can best help them with.</p><p>Due to the rapidly changing environment in startups, this requires frequent cross-team collaboration.</p><p>As <a href="https://www.creativelive.com/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">CreativeLive</a> Director of Partnerships and Business Development, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/kimberlyannmurphy/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Kimberly Pousman</a> explains, “there not only <em>should be</em> overlap between business development and sales, but there <em>needs to be</em> overlap, whether you personally want it or not.”\xa0</p><p>Pousman continues, “One of the keys to being great in either a business development or sales role, is asking the right questions. When you’re looking to grow and expand, you need to ask the right questions, experiment and actively source feedback from others—so if your teams are operating in a silo, they’ll miss out on valuable opportunities to learn from each other and advance your growth rate.”</p><p>Furthermore, the downstream effect is that if this alignment between business development and sales teams isn’t up to par, your sales reps are going to have a difficult time closing enough deals with the leads they’ve got, which leads to frustration and a close rate below the <a href="https://www.pointclear.com/blog/what-should-the-sales-close-rate-be" rel="noopener" target="_blank">20-30% industry average</a> for SaaS.</p><p>If your sales team’s close rate is below 20%, they’re either not closing as well as they should, or your leads aren’t qualified enough.</p><h3><strong>3. What’s the difference in the day-to-day activities of business development reps and sales reps?</strong></h3><p>While the responsibilities of a business development rep can vary a bit based on the unique needs and internal demands of an organization, in general they’re responsible for two main tasks that sit at the core of this role:</p><ul><li><strong>Managing inbound leads:</strong> This translates into working through an internal list, <a href="https://blog.close.com/qualify" rel="noopener" target="_blank">qualifying leads</a> from various marketing campaigns and classifying the right ones as sales opportunities to be passed on to the sales team for further vetting and closing.</li>\n<li><strong>Leading outbound prospecting:</strong> On the flip side, this kind of outreach involves researching and contacting potential customers that haven’t proactively expressed interest in your product through cold calls and cold emails—with the goal of qualifying sales opportunities for your sales team.\xa0</li>\n</ul><p>On the inbound side of things, business development reps sit metaphorically between marketing and sales, filtering marketing leads and qualifying them before assigning them to the right sales rep that can move on to <a href="https://blog.close.com/close-sale" rel="noopener" target="_blank">close the sale</a>.</p><p>When it comes to outbound, business development reps need to first go through your organization’s <a href="https://blog.close.com/unstoppable-sales-team" rel="noopener" target="_blank">sales training</a> process so that they have a clear picture of who your ideal customers are before they go out and begin starting conversations with prospects. Depending upon the size of your company, your business development reps may or may not start with the beginning task of researching prospects before sending an email or calling.</p><p>Ultimately though, the goal of any outbound business development work is to start a conversation and <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/samanthaharrington/2017/05/26/how-to-create-strong-sales-relationships/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">develop a relationship</a> that can be passed on to sales for closing. Everything a business development rep does, should revolve around finding more prospects, qualifying the right ones and routing them to your sales team for closing.</p><p><strong>Now, let’s talk about the responsibilities of sales reps.</strong></p><p>Keeping in mind slight differences to match your unique internal needs, most sales representatives are charged with the following main responsibilities:</p><ul><li><strong>Selling:</strong> Closing deals (ideally with pre-qualified leads from your business development team to save time) using solid arguments and <a href="https://blog.close.com/10-objection-handling-techniques-every-b2b-salesperson-should-know" rel="noopener" target="_blank">objection management</a> with prospective customers.</li>\n<li><strong>Maintaining relationships:</strong> Although a prospect might not be a fit to purchase your product or service today, that doesn’t mean they won’t be in a completely different position 6 months or a year from now—so keeping in touch with leads to encourage future sales is a major part of a sales rep’s responsibilities.</li>\n</ul><p>Most sales representative roles work against a <a href="https://blog.close.com/end-of-year-sales" rel="noopener" target="_blank">sales quota</a>—a thoughtfully calculated monthly or quarterly minimum for the number of customers (or revenue figure) they’re responsible to close. Sales reps are often incentivized with increasing levels of bonus payouts for hitting and exceeding quota within a given period.</p><p>The intense focus on hitting specific customer or revenue benchmarks each quarter is very intentionally designed to encourage sales reps to spend all of their time only on revenue-driving activities. More meetings. More product demos. More sales calls with qualified leads. More contracts sent out for approval. More <a href="https://blog.close.com/follow-up" rel="noopener" target="_blank">follow up emails</a> delivered.</p><p>In a mature sales organization, that means sales reps are empowered to spend less (or zero) time researching prospects, qualifying leads, and booking meetings. Those are activities a business development rep should be helping out with.</p><h3><strong>4. How does a business development call (or email) differ from that of a sales rep?</strong></h3><p>The biggest difference between the calls and emails that business development reps send vs those of a sales rep, is that most business development activities are done toward either completely or relatively <em>cold</em> prospects—meaning that these prospects have likely had little to no interaction with the company before this initial contact is made.\xa0</p><p>That’s when brushing up on your <a href="https://blog.close.com/5-cold-email-templates-that-will-generate-warm-leads-for-your-sales-team" rel="noopener" target="_blank">cold emails</a> and <a href="https://blog.close.com/b2b-cold-calling-tips" rel="noopener" target="_blank">cold calling</a> skills come into play.</p><p>By the time a sales rep is brought on to an account, the relationship has already been established and the lead is qualified, making the communications much more <em>warm</em> than those of a business development rep. The conversation with a sales rep is about how to make a mutually beneficial deal happen, rather than gauging the initial interest or need.</p><h2><strong>Bonus: The key traits you need to look for in every business development (and sales) hire</strong></h2><p>Bringing the right business development and salespeople onto your sales team is crucial in making meaningful progress toward growing your business. If your candidates don’t exhibit these key traits, our advice is to keep searching for the right people that <em>will</em> have a positive impact on your team.</p><h3><strong>Communication and people skills</strong></h3><p>If you hope to cultivate strong relationships with prospects and customers alike, having strong communication and people skills—like the ability to lead a friendly <a href="https://blog.close.com/negotiate" rel="noopener" target="_blank">negotiation</a> from start to finish so that the new customers you bring on are pleased with their decision, is crucial.</p><p>Navigating the process of converting a lead into a paying customer requires the ability to empathize; to fully understand your prospect’s situation and the use case they’ll have for your product to make sure that they’ll truly benefit from your offering.</p><h3><strong>Hunger and drive</strong></h3><p>The most successful salespeople (and business development reps) have an internal drive that pushes them forward and propels them to achieve their sales goals.</p><p>\xa0In the face of a challenge, they’re not discouraged—rather, they look forward to the opportunity to excel, surpass previous expectations and move up to the next level. They’re often incentivized by the prospect of <a href="https://www.ryrob.com/make-money-online/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">earning more money</a>, and respond well to financial rewards for performance improvements.</p><h3><strong>Discipline and confidence</strong></h3><p>Discipline and the confidence in your process beats motivation every single day of the week when you’ve just gotten ten rejections in a row. No matter how skilled or experience you are, in sales there will be moments of defeat that can drain your motivation levels.</p><p>The best salespeople know that sales is a numbers game, and that the only way to recover from rejection &amp; failure is to pick up the phone (or get back into your email) and keep executing. Having the right tools and systems, like our <a href="https://close.com/calling/automation/power-dialer/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Power Dialer</a> will also help keep your team on track and reaching peak productivity levels each day.</p><h3><strong>They’re consultants at heart</strong></h3><p>Just because a salesperson has mastered every tactic in the book and can sell ice to an eskimo doesn’t mean they’re going to bring in customers that’ll <em>still be happy</em> with their purchase decision one, three, six months down the line.</p><p>When hiring a business development or sales rep, look for people that view their role as partnering with prospects to make sure there’s a mutual win-win in each potential deal—ensuring that the customer has a genuine need for the product and that they’re actually a fit for your ideal customer persona of people and companies you want to serve in the first place.</p><p><strong>Want to take your sales game to a new level?

The commands would check what partitions there are on each disk and other details like the total size, used up space and file system etc.    Commands like fdisk, sfdisk and cfdisk are general partitioning tools that can not only display the partition information, but also modify them. 1. fdisk Fdisk is the most commonly used command to check the partitions on a disk. The fdisk command can display the partitions and details like file system type. However it does not report the size of each partitions. $ sudo fdisk -l\r\n\r\nDisk /dev/sda: 500.1 GB, 500107862016 bytes\r\n255 heads, 63 sectors/track, 60801 cylinders, total 976773168 sectors\r\nUnits = sectors of 1 * 512 = 512 bytes\r\nSector size (logical/physical): 512 bytes / 512 bytes\r\nI/O size (minimum/optimal): 512 bytes / 512 bytes\r\nDisk identifier: 0x30093008\r\n\r\n   Device Boot      Start         End      Blocks   Id  System\r\n/dev/sda1   *          63   146801969    73400953+   7  HPFS/NTFS/exFAT\r\n/dev/sda2       146802031   976771071   414984520+   f  W95 Ext\'d (LBA)\r\n/dev/sda5       146802033   351614654   102406311    7  HPFS/NTFS/exFAT\r\n/dev/sda6       351614718   556427339   102406311   83  Linux\r\n/dev/sda7       556429312   560427007     1998848   82  Linux swap / Solaris\r\n/dev/sda8       560429056   976771071   208171008   83  Linux\r\n\r\nDisk /dev/sdb: 4048 MB, 4048551936 bytes\r\n54 heads, 9 sectors/track, 16270 cylinders, total 7907328 sectors\r\nUnits = sectors of 1 * 512 = 512 bytes\r\nSector size (logical/physical): 512 bytes / 512 bytes\r\nI/O size (minimum/optimal): 512 bytes / 512 bytes\r\nDisk identifier: 0x0001135d\r\n\r\n   Device Boot      Start         End      Blocks   Id  System\r\n/dev/sdb1   *        2048     7907327     3952640    b  W95 FAT32 Each device is reported separately with details about size, seconds, id and individual partitions. 2. sfdisk Sfdisk is another utility with a purpose similar to fdisk, but with more features.

It can be used to list out the existing partitions as well as create or modify them. Here is an example of how to use cfdisk to list the partitions. Cfdisk works with one partition at a time. So if you need to see the details of a particular disk, then pass the device name to cfdisk. $ sudo cfdisk /dev/sdb 4. parted Parted is yet another command line utility to list out partitions and modify them if needed. Here is an example that lists out the partition details. $ sudo parted -l\r\nModel: ATA ST3500418AS (scsi)\r\nDisk /dev/sda: 500GB\r\nSector size (logical/physical): 512B/512B\r\nPartition Table: msdos\r\n\r\nNumber  Start   End     Size    Type      File system     Flags\r\n 1      32.3kB  75.2GB  75.2GB  primary   ntfs            boot\r\n 2      75.2GB  500GB   425GB   extended                  lba\r\n 5      75.2GB  180GB   105GB   logical   ntfs\r\n 6      180GB   285GB   105GB   logical   ext4\r\n 7      285GB   287GB   2047MB  logical   linux-swap(v1)\r\n 8      287GB   500GB   213GB   logical   ext4\r\n\r\n\r\nModel: Sony Storage Media (scsi)\r\nDisk /dev/sdb: 4049MB\r\nSector size (logical/physical): 512B/512B\r\nPartition Table: msdos\r\n\r\nNumber  Start   End     Size    Type     File system  Flags\r\n 1      1049kB  4049MB  4048MB  primary  fat32        boot 5. df Df is not a partitioning utility, but prints out details about only mounted file systems. The list generated by df even includes file systems that are not real disk partitions. Here is a simple example $ df -h\r\nFilesystem      Size  Used Avail Use% Mounted on\r\n/dev/sda6        97G   43G   49G  48% /\r\nnone            4.0K     0  4.0K   0% /sys/fs/cgroup\r\nudev            3.9G  8.0K  3.9G   1% /dev\r\ntmpfs           799M  1.7M  797M   1% /run\r\nnone            5.0M     0  5.0M   0% /run/lock\r\nnone            3.9G   12M  3.9G   1% /run/shm\r\nnone            100M   20K  100M   1% /run/user\r\n/dev/sda8       196G  154G   33G  83% /media/13f35f59-f023-4d98-b06f-9dfaebefd6c1\r\n/dev/sda5        98G   37G   62G  38% /media/4668484A68483B47 Only the file systems that start with a /dev are actual devices or partitions. Use grep to filter out real hard disk partitions/file systems. $ df -h | grep ^/dev\r\n/dev/sda6        97G   43G   49G  48% /\r\n/dev/sda8       196G  154G   33G  83% /media/13f35f59-f023-4d98-b06f-9dfaebefd6c1\r\n/dev/sda5        98G   37G   62G  38% /media/4668484A68483B47 To display only real disk partitions along with partition type, use df like this $ df -h --output=source,fstype,size,used,avail,pcent,target -x tmpfs -x devtmpfs\r\nFilesystem     Type     Size  Used Avail Use% Mounted on\r\n/dev/sda6      ext4      97G   43G   49G  48% /\r\n/dev/sda8      ext4     196G  154G   33G  83% /media/13f35f59-f023-4d98-b06f-9dfaebefd6c1\r\n/dev/sda5      fuseblk   98G   37G   62G  38% /media/4668484A68483B47 Note that df shows only the mounted file systems or partitions and not all. 6. pydf Improved version of df, written in python. Prints out all the hard disk partitions in a easy to read manner. $ pydf\r\nFilesystem Size Used Avail Use%             Mounted on                                 \r\n/dev/sda6   96G  43G   48G 44.7 [####.....] /                                          \r\n/dev/sda8  195G 153G   32G 78.4 [#######..] /media/13f35f59-f023-4d98-b06f-9dfaebefd6c1\r\n/dev/sda5   98G  36G   61G 37.1 [###......] /media/4668484A68483B47 Again, pydf is limited to showing only the mounted file systems. 7. lsblk Lists out all the storage blocks, which includes disk partitions and optical drives. Details include the total size of the partition/block and the mount point if any. Does not report the used/free disk space on the partitions. $ lsblk\r\nNAME   MAJ:MIN RM   SIZE RO TYPE MOUNTPOINT\r\nsda      8:0    0 465.8G  0 disk \r\n├─sda1   8:1    0    70G  0 part \r\n├─sda2   8:2    0     1K  0 part \r\n├─sda5   8:5    0  97.7G  0 part /media/4668484A68483B47\r\n├─sda6   8:6    0  97.7G  0 part /\r\n├─sda7   8:7    0   1.9G  0 part [SWAP]\r\n└─sda8   8:8    0 198.5G  0 part /media/13f35f59-f023-4d98-b06f-9dfaebefd6c1\r\nsdb      8:16   1   3.8G  0 disk \r\n└─sdb1   8:17   1   3.8G  0 part \r\nsr0     11:0    1  1024M  0 rom If there is no MOUNTPOINT, then it means that the file system is not yet mounted. For cd/dvd this means that there is no disk. Lsblk is capbale of displaying more information about each device like the label and model. Check out the man page for more information 8. blkid Prints the block device (partitions and storage media) attributes like uuid and file system type. Does not report the space on the partitions. $ sudo blkid\r\n/dev/sda1: UUID="5E38BE8B38BE6227" TYPE="ntfs" \r\n/dev/sda5: UUID="4668484A68483B47" TYPE="ntfs" \r\n/dev/sda6: UUID="6fa5a72a-ba26-4588-a103-74bb6b33a763" TYPE="ext4" \r\n/dev/sda7: UUID="94443023-34a1-4428-8f65-2fb02e571dae" TYPE="swap" \r\n/dev/sda8: UUID="13f35f59-f023-4d98-b06f-9dfaebefd6c1" TYPE="ext4" \r\n/dev/sdb1: UUID="08D1-8024" TYPE="vfat" 9. hwinfo The hwinfo is a general purpose hardware information tool and can be used to print out the disk and partition list. The output however does not print details about each partition like the above commands. $ hwinfo --block --short\r\ndisk:                                                           \r\n  /dev/sda             ST3500418AS\r\n  /dev/sdb             Sony Storage Media\r\npartition:\r\n  /dev/sda1            Partition\r\n  /dev/sda2            Partition\r\n  /dev/sda5            Partition\r\n  /dev/sda6            Partition\r\n  /dev/sda7            Partition\r\n  /dev/sda8            Partition\r\n  /dev/sdb1            Partition\r\ncdrom:\r\n  /dev/sr0             SONY DVD RW DRU-190A Summary The output of parted is concise and complete to get an overview of different partitions, file system on them and the total space. Pydf and df are limited to showing only mounted file systems and the same on them. Fdisk and Sfdisk show a whole lot of information that can take sometime to interpret whereas, Cfdisk is an interactive partitioning tool that display a single device at a time. So try them out, and do not forget to comment below.

It can be used to list out the existing partitions as well as create or modify them. Here is an example of how to use cfdisk to list the partitions. Cfdisk works with one partition at a time. So if you need to see the details of a particular disk, then pass the device name to cfdisk. $ sudo cfdisk /dev/sdb 4. parted Parted is yet another command line utility to list out partitions and modify them if needed. Here is an example that lists out the partition details. $ sudo parted -l\r\nModel: ATA ST3500418AS (scsi)\r\nDisk /dev/sda: 500GB\r\nSector size (logical/physical): 512B/512B\r\nPartition Table: msdos\r\n\r\nNumber  Start   End     Size    Type      File system     Flags\r\n 1      32.3kB  75.2GB  75.2GB  primary   ntfs            boot\r\n 2      75.2GB  500GB   425GB   extended                  lba\r\n 5      75.2GB  180GB   105GB   logical   ntfs\r\n 6      180GB   285GB   105GB   logical   ext4\r\n 7      285GB   287GB   2047MB  logical   linux-swap(v1)\r\n 8      287GB   500GB   213GB   logical   ext4\r\n\r\n\r\nModel: Sony Storage Media (scsi)\r\nDisk /dev/sdb: 4049MB\r\nSector size (logical/physical): 512B/512B\r\nPartition Table: msdos\r\n\r\nNumber  Start   End     Size    Type     File system  Flags\r\n 1      1049kB  4049MB  4048MB  primary  fat32        boot 5. df Df is not a partitioning utility, but prints out details about only mounted file systems. The list generated by df even includes file systems that are not real disk partitions. Here is a simple example $ df -h\r\nFilesystem      Size  Used Avail Use% Mounted on\r\n/dev/sda6        97G   43G   49G  48% /\r\nnone            4.0K     0  4.0K   0% /sys/fs/cgroup\r\nudev            3.9G  8.0K  3.9G   1% /dev\r\ntmpfs           799M  1.7M  797M   1% /run\r\nnone            5.0M     0  5.0M   0% /run/lock\r\nnone            3.9G   12M  3.9G   1% /run/shm\r\nnone            100M   20K  100M   1% /run/user\r\n/dev/sda8       196G  154G   33G  83% /media/13f35f59-f023-4d98-b06f-9dfaebefd6c1\r\n/dev/sda5        98G   37G   62G  38% /media/4668484A68483B47 Only the file systems that start with a /dev are actual devices or partitions. Use grep to filter out real hard disk partitions/file systems. $ df -h | grep ^/dev\r\n/dev/sda6        97G   43G   49G  48% /\r\n/dev/sda8       196G  154G   33G  83% /media/13f35f59-f023-4d98-b06f-9dfaebefd6c1\r\n/dev/sda5        98G   37G   62G  38% /media/4668484A68483B47 To display only real disk partitions along with partition type, use df like this $ df -h --output=source,fstype,size,used,avail,pcent,target -x tmpfs -x devtmpfs\r\nFilesystem     Type     Size  Used Avail Use% Mounted on\r\n/dev/sda6      ext4      97G   43G   49G  48% /\r\n/dev/sda8      ext4     196G  154G   33G  83% /media/13f35f59-f023-4d98-b06f-9dfaebefd6c1\r\n/dev/sda5      fuseblk   98G   37G   62G  38% /media/4668484A68483B47 Note that df shows only the mounted file systems or partitions and not all. 6. pydf Improved version of df, written in python. Prints out all the hard disk partitions in a easy to read manner. $ pydf\r\nFilesystem Size Used Avail Use%             Mounted on                                 \r\n/dev/sda6   96G  43G   48G 44.7 [####.....] /                                          \r\n/dev/sda8  195G 153G   32G 78.4 [#######..] /media/13f35f59-f023-4d98-b06f-9dfaebefd6c1\r\n/dev/sda5   98G  36G   61G 37.1 [###......] /media/4668484A68483B47 Again, pydf is limited to showing only the mounted file systems. 7. lsblk Lists out all the storage blocks, which includes disk partitions and optical drives. Details include the total size of the partition/block and the mount point if any. Does not report the used/free disk space on the partitions. $ lsblk\r\nNAME   MAJ:MIN RM   SIZE RO TYPE MOUNTPOINT\r\nsda      8:0    0 465.8G  0 disk \r\n├─sda1   8:1    0    70G  0 part \r\n├─sda2   8:2    0     1K  0 part \r\n├─sda5   8:5    0  97.7G  0 part /media/4668484A68483B47\r\n├─sda6   8:6    0  97.7G  0 part /\r\n├─sda7   8:7    0   1.9G  0 part [SWAP]\r\n└─sda8   8:8    0 198.5G  0 part /media/13f35f59-f023-4d98-b06f-9dfaebefd6c1\r\nsdb      8:16   1   3.8G  0 disk \r\n└─sdb1   8:17   1   3.8G  0 part \r\nsr0     11:0    1  1024M  0 rom If there is no MOUNTPOINT, then it means that the file system is not yet mounted. For cd/dvd this means that there is no disk. Lsblk is capbale of displaying more information about each device like the label and model. Check out the man page for more information 8. blkid Prints the block device (partitions and storage media) attributes like uuid and file system type. Does not report the space on the partitions. $ sudo blkid\r\n/dev/sda1: UUID="5E38BE8B38BE6227" TYPE="ntfs" \r\n/dev/sda5: UUID="4668484A68483B47" TYPE="ntfs" \r\n/dev/sda6: UUID="6fa5a72a-ba26-4588-a103-74bb6b33a763" TYPE="ext4" \r\n/dev/sda7: UUID="94443023-34a1-4428-8f65-2fb02e571dae" TYPE="swap" \r\n/dev/sda8: UUID="13f35f59-f023-4d98-b06f-9dfaebefd6c1" TYPE="ext4" \r\n/dev/sdb1: UUID="08D1-8024" TYPE="vfat" 9. hwinfo The hwinfo is a general purpose hardware information tool and can be used to print out the disk and partition list. The output however does not print details about each partition like the above commands. $ hwinfo --block --short\r\ndisk:                                                           \r\n  /dev/sda             ST3500418AS\r\n  /dev/sdb             Sony Storage Media\r\npartition:\r\n  /dev/sda1            Partition\r\n  /dev/sda2            Partition\r\n  /dev/sda5            Partition\r\n  /dev/sda6            Partition\r\n  /dev/sda7            Partition\r\n  /dev/sda8            Partition\r\n  /dev/sdb1            Partition\r\ncdrom:\r\n  /dev/sr0             SONY DVD RW DRU-190A Summary The output of parted is concise and complete to get an overview of different partitions, file system on them and the total space. Pydf and df are limited to showing only mounted file systems and the same on them. Fdisk and Sfdisk show a whole lot of information that can take sometime to interpret whereas, Cfdisk is an interactive partitioning tool that display a single device at a time. So try them out, and do not forget to comment below.

These potential partners <i>may one day </i>be customers - maybe - but they are not <i>current </i>sales prospects.

Note that, while inside smaller companies the same person takes on multiple roles at different times (such a VP or CEO) - it is still important to know the difference: Sales = Transactions. Sales is responsible for selling a specific product or service, with a clear price and value, to an identifiable individual customer . Sales is the activity that happens once the specific customer is identified. Marketing: Identifies the needs and types of customers so it can attract customers. Marketing devises the best way to get the products into the hands of the customers. Marketing often plays a big role in product development in gathering or validating the feature/benefits required by customers (or by the overall market). Marketing exists to make sales easier. (h/t to Jason Lemkin) Strategic marketing focuses on customers as groups - to better understand how to differentiate the product, and how to more effectively target and sell the products to each group. Tactical marketing focuses on getting customers closer to the sales transaction . Marketing-promotions, trial offers etc are usually in this category. This is about attracting customers. For an ecommerce business, marketing goes all the way to the transaction, and "sales" is automated. In other businesses, marketing brings customers to "the door" while sales tries to convert the customer\'s interest or presence into a transaction. Business Development: Identifies and executes NEW areas of business - new markets, new distribution channels, new products: typically through the use of partnerships between another company and an internal department at your company. The focus of "bizdev" is on new and atypical , interactions with external partners - who are * not * customers or sales prospects. These potential partners may one day be customers - maybe - but they are not current sales prospects. Once the business is no longer new, and becomes a repeatable kind of business, then the relationship transitions to another part of the company (sales, marketing, product development, engineering). . For Business Development, the goal is not a sales transaction: Business Development is not formally empowered to sell a product directly to a customer or customers - otherwise they would be competing with the Sales team. Business Development should never be dealing with the sale of existing products to existing (identifiable) customers, no matter how large the revenue opportunity - only sales does that. Nor should Bizdev be setting up distribution channels - this is a marketing function. Example For instance, when Amazon decided to add online movies to it\'s product offerings: Initially this was a bizdev role because of a brand new area of business - with a new business model, new distribution, etc. that required an external partner(s) working with internal Amazon departments. Bizdev would be coordinating the internal/external activity until all had the licensing terms fleshed out, pricing, marketing strategy, created a new area of the site with new kinds of distribution ... once that all happens it is standard business, and then out of the hands of bizdev and then- driven by marketing, sales, product etc. A Sales Executive (probably not a role that should formally exist in a pure online / ecommerce company) would either focus on \'big ticket\' sales that require the longest 1-1/face to face selling cycle, and/or manages other sales personnel . For instance, at a car dealership: The Sales Executive might manage the floor sales personnel (deciding commissions policy etc), while also being the person to negotiate a deal with a large business to buy 50 vehicles for use as company cars. CONFUSION Be wary of folks who take the stance of defining any of these terms loosely, as they please. Quotas and Commissions If a job posting or job description for a Business Development Manager talks about a "Quota" or Commission - then it is a Sales Position.

So what is the difference and why does it matter? The short version Business development is the process of finding the match between a product (or solution) and a segment in the market. Sales is the process of systematically generating revenue with the product (solution) in the chosen market segment in the race for market leadership. Business development Business development will work very closely with product management on the competitive positioning and the feature set as well as with marketing for developing the most productive definition of the value proposition, the identification of the most effective communication channels and the most cost/effective lead generation process. This match-making process is based on continuous and close interaction with potential customers. The objective is not revenue generation, but finding the right product-market fit. When we move into a new market (which may also be a new geographic market) where the environment is different from where we are already operating, then we need to go through the business development process first before we employ sales resources.

Social engineering processes Business development, marketing and sales are business processes just like R&D, G&A, manufacturing and logistics. I call them social engineering processes since they depend heavily on understanding and influencing the behavior of human beings outside our direct control. Unless we define these processes, describe them, test them, formalize them, optimize them and scale them then achieving market leadership will be by accident only.

So what is the difference and why does it matter? The short version Business development is the process of finding the match between a product (or solution) and a segment in the market. Sales is the process of systematically generating revenue with the product (solution) in the chosen market segment in the race for market leadership. Business development Business development will work very closely with product management on the competitive positioning and the feature set as well as with marketing for developing the most productive definition of the value proposition, the identification of the most effective communication channels and the most cost/effective lead generation process.

When we move into a new market (which may also be a new geographic market) where the environment is different from where we are already operating, then we need to go through the business development process first before we employ sales resources. Sales Sales is the tactical process of revenue generation when we have proven and documented product/market fit and defined the most effective way to support our customers’ buying journey.

If the packet had been\n                        destined for port 139 (NetBIOS), it doesn\'t match any of the rules, and the * rule\n                        ultimately denies the packet. \n                     </p><p>You might want to add a DENY rule in a situation where you legitimately need to open\n                        a\n                        wide range of ports, but there are certain ports within that range you want to deny.\n                        Just make\n                        sure to place the DENY rule earlier in the table than the rule that allows the wide\n                        range of\n                        port traffic.\n                     </p><div class="aws-note"><p class="aws-note">Important</p><p>With Elastic Load Balancing, if the subnet for your back-end instances has a network\n                           ACL in which you\'ve\n                           added a DENY rule for all traffic with a source of <code class="code">0.0.0.0/0</code> or the subnet\'s\n                           CIDR, then your load balancer can\'t carry out health checks on the instances.

Contents Network ACL Basics  Network ACL Rules  Default Network ACL  Custom Network ACL  Ephemeral Ports  Working with Network ACLs  Example: Controlling Access to Instances in a Subnet  API and Command Overview  Network ACL Basics The following are the basic things that you need to know about network ACLs:  Your VPC automatically comes with a modifiable default network ACL. By default, it\n                                 allows all inbound and outbound IPv4 traffic and, if applicable, IPv6 traffic.    You can create a custom network ACL and associate it with a subnet. By default, each\n                                 custom network ACL denies all inbound and outbound traffic until you add rules.    Each subnet in your VPC must be associated with a network ACL. If you don't explicitly\n                                 associate a subnet with a network ACL, the subnet is automatically associated with\n                                 the\n                                 default network ACL.    You can associate a network ACL with multiple subnets; however, a subnet can be\n                                 associated with only one network ACL at a time. When you associate a network ACL with\n                                 a\n                                 subnet, the previous association is removed.    A network ACL contains a numbered list of rules that we evaluate in order, starting\n                                 with the lowest numbered rule, to determine whether traffic is allowed in or out\n                                 of any subnet associated with the network ACL. The highest number that you can\n                                 use for a rule is 32766. We recommend that you start by creating rules in\n                                 increments (for example, increments of 10 or 100) so that you can insert new\n                                 rules where you need to later on.    A network ACL has separate inbound and outbound rules, and each rule can either allow\n                                 or deny traffic.    Network ACLs are stateless; responses to allowed inbound traffic are subject to the\n                                 rules for outbound traffic (and vice versa).   For more information, see Amazon VPC Limits . Network ACL Rules You can add or remove rules from the default network ACL, or create additional network\n                        ACLs for your\n                        VPC. When you add or remove rules from a network ACL, the changes are automatically\n                        applied to the\n                        subnets it's associated with. The following are the parts of a network ACL rule:  Rule number. Rules are evaluated starting with the lowest numbered rule. As soon as\n                                 a\n                                 rule matches traffic, it's applied regardless of any higher-numbered rule that may\n                                 contradict it.    Protocol. You can specify any protocol that has a standard protocol number. For more\n                                 information, see Protocol\n                                    Numbers . If you specify ICMP as the protocol, you can specify any or all of the\n                                 ICMP types and codes.    [Inbound rules only] The source of the traffic (CIDR range) and the destination\n                                 (listening) port or port range.    [Outbound rules only] The destination for the traffic (CIDR range) and the \n                                 destination port or port range.    Choice of ALLOW or DENY for the specified traffic.   Default Network ACL The default network ACL is configured to allow all traffic to flow in and out of the\n                        subnets with which it is associated. Each network ACL also includes a rule whose rule\n                        number\n                        is an asterisk. This rule ensures that if a packet doesn't match any of the other\n                        numbered\n                        rules, it's denied. You can't modify or remove this rule. The following is an example default network ACL for a VPC that supports IPv4 only. Inbound  Rule #  Type   Protocol   Port Range  Source   Allow/Deny   100   All IPv4 traffic   All    All   0.0.0.0/0   ALLOW    *   All IPv4 traffic   All    All   0.0.0.0/0   DENY    Outbound   Rule #  Type   Protocol    Port Range  Destination   Allow/Deny   100   All IPv4 traffic   All    All   0.0.0.0/0   ALLOW    *   All IPv4 traffic   All    All   0.0.0.0/0   DENY   If you create a VPC with an IPv6 CIDR block or if you associate an IPv6 CIDR block\n                        with\n                        your existing VPC, we automatically add rules that allow all IPv6 traffic to flow\n                        in and out\n                        of your subnet. We also add rules whose rule numbers are an asterisk that ensures\n                        that a\n                        packet is denied if it doesn't match any of the other numbered rules. You can't modify\n                        or\n                        remove these rules. The following is an example default network ACL for a VPC that\n                        supports\n                        IPv4 and IPv6. Note If you've modified your default network ACL's inbound rules, we do not automatically\n                           add\n                           an ALLOW rule for inbound IPv6 traffic when you associate an IPv6 block with your\n                           VPC.\n                           Similarly, if you've modified the outbound rules, we do not automatically add an ALLOW\n                           rule\n                           for outbound IPv6 traffic.

It includes rules that allow HTTP and HTTPS traffic in (inbound rules 100 and\n                        110). There's a corresponding outbound rule that enables responses to that inbound\n                        traffic (outbound rule 120, which covers ephemeral ports 32768-65535). For more\n                        information about how to select the appropriate ephemeral port range, see Ephemeral Ports . The network ACL also includes inbound rules that allow SSH and RDP traffic into the\n                        subnet. The outbound rule 120 enables responses to egress the subnet. The network ACL has outbound rules (100 and 110) that allow outbound HTTP and HTTPS\n                        traffic out of the subnet. There's a corresponding inbound rule that enables responses\n                        to that outbound traffic (inbound rule 140, which covers ephemeral ports 32768-65535). Note Each network ACL includes a default rule whose rule number is an asterisk. This rule\n                           ensures that if a packet doesn't match any of the other rules, it's denied. You can't\n                           modify\n                           or remove this rule.

This range is an example only.

This range is an example only. For more information about how to select the\n                                       \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tappropriate ephemeral port range, see Ephemeral Ports .    *   All traffic   All    All   0.0.0.0/0   DENY    Denies all outbound IPv4 traffic not already handled by a preceding rule (not\n                                       modifiable).   As a packet comes to the subnet, we evaluate it against the ingress rules of the ACL\n                        the\n                        subnet is associated with (starting at the top of the list of rules, and moving to\n                        the\n                        bottom). Here's how the evaluation goes if the packet is destined for the SSL port\n                        (443). The packet doesn't match the first rule evaluated (rule 100). It does match\n                        the\n                        second rule (110), which allows the packet into the subnet. If the packet had been\n                        destined for port 139 (NetBIOS), it doesn't match any of the rules, and the * rule\n                        ultimately denies the packet. You might want to add a DENY rule in a situation where you legitimately need to open\n                        a\n                        wide range of ports, but there are certain ports within that range you want to deny.\n                        Just make\n                        sure to place the DENY rule earlier in the table than the rule that allows the wide\n                        range of\n                        port traffic. Important With Elastic Load Balancing, if the subnet for your back-end instances has a network\n                           ACL in which you've\n                           added a DENY rule for all traffic with a source of 0.0.0.0/0 or the subnet's\n                           CIDR, then your load balancer can't carry out health checks on the instances. For\n                           more\n                           information about the recommended network ACL rules for your load balancers and back-end\n                           instances, see Network ACLs for Load Balancers in a VPC in the User Guide for Classic Load Balancers . The following table shows the same example of a custom network ACL for a VPC that\n                        has an\n                        associated IPv6 CIDR block. This network ACL includes rules for all IPv6 HTTP and\n                        HTTPS\n                        traffic. In this case, new rules were inserted between the existing rules for IPv4\n                        traffic;\n                        however, you can also add the rules as higher number rules after the IPv4 rules. IPv4\n                        and IPv6\n                        traffic are separate; therefore, none of the rules for the IPv4 traffic apply to the\n                        IPv6\n                        traffic.

Ephemeral Ports The example network ACL in the preceding section uses an ephemeral port range of\n                        \t\t\t32768-65535. However, you might want to use a different range for your network\n                        ACLs\n                        \t\t\tdepending on the type of client that you're using or with which you're\n                        \t\t\tcommunicating. The client that initiates the request chooses the ephemeral port range. The range\n                        varies\n                        depending on the client's operating system. Many Linux kernels (including the Amazon\n                        Linux kernel) use\n                        ports 32768-61000. Requests originating from Elastic Load Balancing use ports 1024-65535.\n                        Windows operating\n                        systems through Windows Server 2003 use ports 1025-5000. Windows Server 2008 and later\n                        versions use ports 49152-65535. A NAT gateway uses ports 1024-65535. For example,\n                        if a request\n                        comes into a web server in your VPC from a Windows XP client on the Internet, your\n                        network ACL\n                        must have an outbound rule to enable traffic destined for ports 1025-5000. If an instance in your VPC is the client initiating a request, your network ACL must\n                        have\n                        an inbound rule to enable traffic destined for the ephemeral ports specific to the\n                        type of\n                        instance (Amazon Linux, Windows Server 2008, and so on). In practice, to cover the different types of clients that might initiate traffic to\n                        public-facing instances in your VPC, you can open ephemeral ports 1024-65535. However,\n                        you can\n                        also add rules to the ACL to deny traffic on any malicious ports within that range.\n                        Ensure\n                        that you place the DENY rules earlier in the table than the ALLOW rules that open\n                        the wide\n                        range of ephemeral ports. Working with Network ACLs The following tasks show you how to work with network ACLs using the Amazon VPC console. Tasks Determining Network ACL Associations  Creating a Network ACL  Adding and Deleting Rules  Associating a Subnet with a Network ACL  Disassociating a Network ACL from a Subnet  Changing a Subnet's Network ACL  Deleting a Network ACL  Determining Network ACL Associations You can use the Amazon VPC console to determine the network ACL that's associated\n                        with a\n                        subnet. Network ACLs can be associated with more than one subnet, so you can also\n                        determine\n                        the subnets that are associated with a network ACL. To determine which network ACL is associated with a subnet  Open the Amazon VPC console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/vpc/ .    In the navigation pane, choose Subnets , and then select the\n                              subnet.  The network ACL associated with the subnet is included in the Network\n                                 ACL tab, along with the network ACL's rules.   To determine which subnets are associated with a network ACL  Open the Amazon VPC console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/vpc/ .    In the navigation pane, choose Network ACLs . The Associated With column indicates the number of associated subnets\n                              for each network ACL.    Select a network ACL.    In the details pane, choose Subnet Associations to display the\n                              subnets associated with the network ACL.   Creating a Network ACL You can create a custom network ACL for your VPC. By default, a network ACL that you\n                        create blocks all inbound and outbound traffic until you add rules, and is not associated\n                        with a subnet until you explicitly associate it with one. To create a network ACL  Open the Amazon VPC console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/vpc/ .    In the navigation pane, choose Network ACLs .    Choose Create Network ACL .    In the Create Network ACL dialog box, optionally name your\n                              network ACL, and then select the ID of your VPC from the VPC list,\n                              and choose Yes, Create .   Adding and Deleting Rules When you add or delete a rule from an ACL, any subnets associated with the ACL are\n                        subject to the change. You don't have to terminate and relaunch the instances in the\n                        subnet;\n                        the changes take effect after a short period. If you're using the Amazon EC2 API or a command line tool, you can't modify rules;\n                        you\n                        can only add and delete rules. If you're using the Amazon VPC console, you can modify\n                        the entries\n                        for existing rules (the console removes the rule and adds a new rule for you). If\n                        you need\n                        to change the order of a rule in the ACL, you must add a new rule with the new rule\n                        number,\n                        and then delete the original rule. To add rules to a network ACL  Open the Amazon VPC console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/vpc/ .    In the navigation pane, choose Network ACLs .    In the details pane, choose either the Inbound Rules or Outbound Rules tab, depending on the type of rule that you need\n                              to add, and then choose Edit .    In Rule # , enter a rule number (for example, 100). The rule\n                              \t\t\tnumber must not already be used in the network ACL. We process the rules in order,\n                              \t\t\tstarting with the lowest number.  Tip We recommend that you leave gaps between the rule numbers (such as 100, 200, 300),\n                                 rather than using sequential numbers (101, 102, 103). This makes it easier add a new\n                                 rule without having to renumber the existing rules.    Select a rule from the Type list. For example, to add a rule\n                              for HTTP, choose HTTP . To add a rule to allow all TCP traffic,\n                              choose All TCP . For some of these options (for example, HTTP), we\n                              fill in the port for you. To use a protocol that's not listed, choose Custom\n                                 Protocol Rule .    (Optional) If you're creating a custom protocol rule, select the protocol's\n                              number and name from the Protocol list. For more\n                              information, see IANA\n                                 List of Protocol Numbers .    (Optional) If the protocol you've selected requires a port number, enter the port\n                              number or\n                              port range separated by a hyphen (for example, 49152-65535).    In the Source or Destination field\n                              (depending on whether this is an inbound or outbound rule), enter the CIDR range that\n                              the rule applies to.    From the Allow/Deny list, select ALLOW to\n                              allow the specified traffic or DENY to deny the specified\n                              traffic.    (Optional) To add another rule, choose Add another rule , and\n                              repeat steps 4 to 9 as required.    When you are done, choose Save .   To delete a rule from a network ACL  Open the Amazon VPC console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/vpc/ .    In the navigation pane, choose Network ACLs , and then select\n                              the network ACL.    In the details pane, select either the Inbound Rules or Outbound Rules tab, and then choose Edit .\n                              Choose Remove for the rule you want to delete, and then choose Save .   Associating a Subnet with a Network ACL To apply the rules of a network ACL to a particular subnet, you must associate the\n                        subnet\n                        with the network ACL. You can associate a network ACL with multiple subnets; however,\n                        a subnet can be\n                        associated with only one network ACL. Any subnet not associated with a particular\n                        ACL is associated\n                        with the default network ACL by default. To associate a subnet with a network ACL  Open the Amazon VPC console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/vpc/ .    In the navigation pane, choose Network ACLs , and then select\n                              the network ACL.    In the details pane, on the Subnet Associations tab, choose Edit . Select the Associate check box for the\n                              subnet to associate with the network ACL, and then choose Save .   Disassociating a Network ACL from a Subnet You can disassociate a custom network ACL from a subnet — by doing so, the subnet\n                        is then automatically associated with the default network ACL. To disassociate a subnet from a network ACL  Open the Amazon VPC console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/vpc/ .    In the navigation pane, choose Network ACLs , and then select\n                              the network ACL.    In the details pane, choose the Subnet Associations tab.    Choose Edit , and then deselect the Associate check box for the subnet. Choose Save .   Changing a Subnet's Network ACL You can change the network ACL that's associated with a subnet. For example, when\n                        you\n                        create a subnet, it is initially associated with the default network ACL. You might\n                        want to\n                        instead associate it with a custom network ACL that you've created. After changing a subnet's network ACL, you don't have to terminate and relaunch the\n                        instances in\n                        the subnet; the changes take effect after a short period. To change a subnet's network ACL association  Open the Amazon VPC console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/vpc/ .    In the navigation pane, choose Subnets , and then select the\n                              subnet.    Choose the Network ACL tab, and then choose Edit .    Select the network ACL to associate the subnet with from the Change\n                                 to list, and then choose Save .   Deleting a Network ACL You can delete a network ACL only if there are no subnets associated with it. You\n                        can't\n                        delete the default network ACL. To delete a network ACL  Open the Amazon VPC console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/vpc/ .    In the navigation pane, choose Network ACLs .    Select the network ACL, and then choose Delete .    In the confirmation dialog box, choose Yes, Delete .   Example: Controlling Access to Instances in a Subnet In this example, instances in your subnet can communicate with each other, and are\n                        accessible from a trusted remote computer. The remote computer may be a computer in\n                        your local\n                        network or an instance in a different subnet or VPC that you use to connect to your\n                        instances\n                        to perform administrative tasks. Your security group rules and network ACL rules allow\n                        access\n                        from the IP address of your remote computer (172.31.1.2/32). All other traffic from\n                        the\n                        Internet or other networks is denied. All instances use the same security group (sg-1a2b3c4d), with the following rules. Inbound\n                                       Rules  Protocol Type  Protocol  Port Range  Source  Comments  All traffic  All  All  sg-1a2b3c4d  Enables instances associated with the same security group to communicate with\n                                    each other.  SSH  TCP  22  172.31.1.2/32  Allows inbound SSH access from the remote computer. If the instance is a Windows\n                                    computer, then this rule must use the RDP protocol for port 3389 instead.  Outbound\n                                       Rules  Protocol Type  Protocol  Port Range  Destination  Comments  All traffic  All  All  sg-1a2b3c4d  Enables instances associated with the same security group to communicate with\n                                    each other.  The subnet is associated with a network ACL that has the following rules. Inbound\n                                       Rules  Rule #  Type  Protocol  Port Range  Source  Allow/Deny  Comments  100  SSH  TCP  22  172.31.1.2/32  ALLOW  Allows inbound traffic from the remote computer. If the instance is a Windows\n                                    computer, then this rule must use the RDP protocol for port 3389 instead.  *  All traffic  All  All  0.0.0.0/0  DENY  Denies all other inbound traffic that does not match the previous rule.  Outbound\n                                       Rules  Rule #  Type  Protocol  Port Range  Destination  Allow/Deny  Comments  100  Custom TCP  TCP  1024-65535  172.31.1.2/32  ALLOW  Allows outbound responses to the remote computer. Network ACLs are stateless,\n                                    therefore this rule is required to allow response traffic for inbound\n                                    requests.  *  All traffic  All  All  0.0.0.0/0  DENY  Denies all other outbound traffic that does not match the previous rule.  This scenario gives you the flexibility to change the security groups or security\n                        group\n                        rules for your instances, and have the network ACL as the backup layer of defense.\n                        The network\n                        ACL rules apply to all instances in the subnet, so if you accidentally make your security\n                        group rules too permissive, the network ACL rules continue to permit access only from\n                        the\n                        single IP address. For example, the following rules are more permissive than the earlier\n                        rules\n                        — they allow inbound SSH access from any IP address. Inbound\n                                       Rules  Type  Protocol  Port Range  Source  Comments  All traffic  All  All  sg-1a2b3c4d  Enables instances associated with the same security group to communicate with\n                                    each other.  SSH  TCP  22  0.0.0.0/0  Allows SSH access from any IP address.

However, only other instances within the subnet and your remote computer are able\n                        to\n                        access this instance. The network ACL rules still prevent all inbound traffic to the\n                        subnet\n                        except from your remote computer.

Contents Network ACL Basics  Network ACL Rules  Default Network ACL  Custom Network ACL  Ephemeral Ports  Working with Network ACLs  Example: Controlling Access to Instances in a Subnet  API and Command Overview  Network ACL Basics The following are the basic things that you need to know about network ACLs:  Your VPC automatically comes with a modifiable default network ACL. By default, it\n                                 allows all inbound and outbound IPv4 traffic and, if applicable, IPv6 traffic.    You can create a custom network ACL and associate it with a subnet. By default, each\n                                 custom network ACL denies all inbound and outbound traffic until you add rules.    Each subnet in your VPC must be associated with a network ACL. If you don't explicitly\n                                 associate a subnet with a network ACL, the subnet is automatically associated with\n                                 the\n                                 default network ACL.    You can associate a network ACL with multiple subnets; however, a subnet can be\n                                 associated with only one network ACL at a time. When you associate a network ACL with\n                                 a\n                                 subnet, the previous association is removed.    A network ACL contains a numbered list of rules that we evaluate in order, starting\n                                 with the lowest numbered rule, to determine whether traffic is allowed in or out\n                                 of any subnet associated with the network ACL. The highest number that you can\n                                 use for a rule is 32766. We recommend that you start by creating rules in\n                                 increments (for example, increments of 10 or 100) so that you can insert new\n                                 rules where you need to later on.    A network ACL has separate inbound and outbound rules, and each rule can either allow\n                                 or deny traffic.    Network ACLs are stateless; responses to allowed inbound traffic are subject to the\n                                 rules for outbound traffic (and vice versa).   For more information, see Amazon VPC Limits . Network ACL Rules You can add or remove rules from the default network ACL, or create additional network\n                        ACLs for your\n                        VPC. When you add or remove rules from a network ACL, the changes are automatically\n                        applied to the\n                        subnets it's associated with. The following are the parts of a network ACL rule:  Rule number. Rules are evaluated starting with the lowest numbered rule. As soon as\n                                 a\n                                 rule matches traffic, it's applied regardless of any higher-numbered rule that may\n                                 contradict it.    Protocol. You can specify any protocol that has a standard protocol number. For more\n                                 information, see Protocol\n                                    Numbers . If you specify ICMP as the protocol, you can specify any or all of the\n                                 ICMP types and codes.    [Inbound rules only] The source of the traffic (CIDR range) and the destination\n                                 (listening) port or port range.    [Outbound rules only] The destination for the traffic (CIDR range) and the \n                                 destination port or port range.    Choice of ALLOW or DENY for the specified traffic.   Default Network ACL The default network ACL is configured to allow all traffic to flow in and out of the\n                        subnets with which it is associated. Each network ACL also includes a rule whose rule\n                        number\n                        is an asterisk. This rule ensures that if a packet doesn't match any of the other\n                        numbered\n                        rules, it's denied. You can't modify or remove this rule. The following is an example default network ACL for a VPC that supports IPv4 only. Inbound  Rule #  Type   Protocol   Port Range  Source   Allow/Deny   100   All IPv4 traffic   All    All   0.0.0.0/0   ALLOW    *   All IPv4 traffic   All    All   0.0.0.0/0   DENY    Outbound   Rule #  Type   Protocol    Port Range  Destination   Allow/Deny   100   All IPv4 traffic   All    All   0.0.0.0/0   ALLOW    *   All IPv4 traffic   All    All   0.0.0.0/0   DENY   If you create a VPC with an IPv6 CIDR block or if you associate an IPv6 CIDR block\n                        with\n                        your existing VPC, we automatically add rules that allow all IPv6 traffic to flow\n                        in and out\n                        of your subnet. We also add rules whose rule numbers are an asterisk that ensures\n                        that a\n                        packet is denied if it doesn't match any of the other numbered rules. You can't modify\n                        or\n                        remove these rules. The following is an example default network ACL for a VPC that\n                        supports\n                        IPv4 and IPv6. Note If you've modified your default network ACL's inbound rules, we do not automatically\n                           add\n                           an ALLOW rule for inbound IPv6 traffic when you associate an IPv6 block with your\n                           VPC.\n                           Similarly, if you've modified the outbound rules, we do not automatically add an ALLOW\n                           rule\n                           for outbound IPv6 traffic. Inbound  Rule #  Type   Protocol   Port Range  Source   Allow/Deny   100   All IPv4 traffic   All    All   0.0.0.0/0   ALLOW    101    All IPv6 traffic    All    All    ::/0    ALLOW    *   All traffic   All    All   0.0.0.0/0   DENY    *    All IPv6 traffic    All    All    ::/0    DENY    Outbound   Rule #  Type   Protocol    Port Range  Destination   Allow/Deny   100   All traffic   All    All   0.0.0.0/0   ALLOW    101    All IPv6 traffic    All    All    ::/0    ALLOW    *   All traffic   All    All   0.0.0.0/0   DENY    *    All IPv6 traffic    All    All    ::/0    DENY   Custom Network ACL The following table shows an example of a custom network ACL for a VPC that supports\n                        IPv4\n                        only. It includes rules that allow HTTP and HTTPS traffic in (inbound rules 100 and\n                        110). There's a corresponding outbound rule that enables responses to that inbound\n                        traffic (outbound rule 120, which covers ephemeral ports 32768-65535). For more\n                        information about how to select the appropriate ephemeral port range, see Ephemeral Ports . The network ACL also includes inbound rules that allow SSH and RDP traffic into the\n                        subnet. The outbound rule 120 enables responses to egress the subnet. The network ACL has outbound rules (100 and 110) that allow outbound HTTP and HTTPS\n                        traffic out of the subnet. There's a corresponding inbound rule that enables responses\n                        to that outbound traffic (inbound rule 140, which covers ephemeral ports 32768-65535). Note Each network ACL includes a default rule whose rule number is an asterisk. This rule\n                           ensures that if a packet doesn't match any of the other rules, it's denied. You can't\n                           modify\n                           or remove this rule.

This range is an example only. For more information about how to select the\n                                       \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tappropriate ephemeral port range, see Ephemeral Ports .    *   All traffic   All    All   0.0.0.0/0   DENY    Denies all outbound IPv4 traffic not already handled by a preceding rule (not\n                                       modifiable).   As a packet comes to the subnet, we evaluate it against the ingress rules of the ACL\n                        the\n                        subnet is associated with (starting at the top of the list of rules, and moving to\n                        the\n                        bottom). Here's how the evaluation goes if the packet is destined for the SSL port\n                        (443). The packet doesn't match the first rule evaluated (rule 100). It does match\n                        the\n                        second rule (110), which allows the packet into the subnet. If the packet had been\n                        destined for port 139 (NetBIOS), it doesn't match any of the rules, and the * rule\n                        ultimately denies the packet. You might want to add a DENY rule in a situation where you legitimately need to open\n                        a\n                        wide range of ports, but there are certain ports within that range you want to deny.\n                        Just make\n                        sure to place the DENY rule earlier in the table than the rule that allows the wide\n                        range of\n                        port traffic. Important With Elastic Load Balancing, if the subnet for your back-end instances has a network\n                           ACL in which you've\n                           added a DENY rule for all traffic with a source of 0.0.0.0/0 or the subnet's\n                           CIDR, then your load balancer can't carry out health checks on the instances. For\n                           more\n                           information about the recommended network ACL rules for your load balancers and back-end\n                           instances, see Network ACLs for Load Balancers in a VPC in the User Guide for Classic Load Balancers . The following table shows the same example of a custom network ACL for a VPC that\n                        has an\n                        associated IPv6 CIDR block. This network ACL includes rules for all IPv6 HTTP and\n                        HTTPS\n                        traffic. In this case, new rules were inserted between the existing rules for IPv4\n                        traffic;\n                        however, you can also add the rules as higher number rules after the IPv4 rules. IPv4\n                        and IPv6\n                        traffic are separate; therefore, none of the rules for the IPv4 traffic apply to the\n                        IPv6\n                        traffic.

Ephemeral Ports The example network ACL in the preceding section uses an ephemeral port range of\n                        \t\t\t32768-65535. However, you might want to use a different range for your network\n                        ACLs\n                        \t\t\tdepending on the type of client that you're using or with which you're\n                        \t\t\tcommunicating. The client that initiates the request chooses the ephemeral port range. The range\n                        varies\n                        depending on the client's operating system. Many Linux kernels (including the Amazon\n                        Linux kernel) use\n                        ports 32768-61000. Requests originating from Elastic Load Balancing use ports 1024-65535.\n                        Windows operating\n                        systems through Windows Server 2003 use ports 1025-5000. Windows Server 2008 and later\n                        versions use ports 49152-65535. A NAT gateway uses ports 1024-65535. For example,\n                        if a request\n                        comes into a web server in your VPC from a Windows XP client on the Internet, your\n                        network ACL\n                        must have an outbound rule to enable traffic destined for ports 1025-5000. If an instance in your VPC is the client initiating a request, your network ACL must\n                        have\n                        an inbound rule to enable traffic destined for the ephemeral ports specific to the\n                        type of\n                        instance (Amazon Linux, Windows Server 2008, and so on). In practice, to cover the different types of clients that might initiate traffic to\n                        public-facing instances in your VPC, you can open ephemeral ports 1024-65535. However,\n                        you can\n                        also add rules to the ACL to deny traffic on any malicious ports within that range.\n                        Ensure\n                        that you place the DENY rules earlier in the table than the ALLOW rules that open\n                        the wide\n                        range of ephemeral ports. Working with Network ACLs The following tasks show you how to work with network ACLs using the Amazon VPC console. Tasks Determining Network ACL Associations  Creating a Network ACL  Adding and Deleting Rules  Associating a Subnet with a Network ACL  Disassociating a Network ACL from a Subnet  Changing a Subnet's Network ACL  Deleting a Network ACL  Determining Network ACL Associations You can use the Amazon VPC console to determine the network ACL that's associated\n                        with a\n                        subnet. Network ACLs can be associated with more than one subnet, so you can also\n                        determine\n                        the subnets that are associated with a network ACL. To determine which network ACL is associated with a subnet  Open the Amazon VPC console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/vpc/ .    In the navigation pane, choose Subnets , and then select the\n                              subnet.  The network ACL associated with the subnet is included in the Network\n                                 ACL tab, along with the network ACL's rules.   To determine which subnets are associated with a network ACL  Open the Amazon VPC console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/vpc/ .    In the navigation pane, choose Network ACLs . The Associated With column indicates the number of associated subnets\n                              for each network ACL.    Select a network ACL.    In the details pane, choose Subnet Associations to display the\n                              subnets associated with the network ACL.   Creating a Network ACL You can create a custom network ACL for your VPC. By default, a network ACL that you\n                        create blocks all inbound and outbound traffic until you add rules, and is not associated\n                        with a subnet until you explicitly associate it with one. To create a network ACL  Open the Amazon VPC console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/vpc/ .    In the navigation pane, choose Network ACLs .    Choose Create Network ACL .    In the Create Network ACL dialog box, optionally name your\n                              network ACL, and then select the ID of your VPC from the VPC list,\n                              and choose Yes, Create .   Adding and Deleting Rules When you add or delete a rule from an ACL, any subnets associated with the ACL are\n                        subject to the change. You don't have to terminate and relaunch the instances in the\n                        subnet;\n                        the changes take effect after a short period. If you're using the Amazon EC2 API or a command line tool, you can't modify rules;\n                        you\n                        can only add and delete rules. If you're using the Amazon VPC console, you can modify\n                        the entries\n                        for existing rules (the console removes the rule and adds a new rule for you). If\n                        you need\n                        to change the order of a rule in the ACL, you must add a new rule with the new rule\n                        number,\n                        and then delete the original rule. To add rules to a network ACL  Open the Amazon VPC console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/vpc/ .    In the navigation pane, choose Network ACLs .    In the details pane, choose either the Inbound Rules or Outbound Rules tab, depending on the type of rule that you need\n                              to add, and then choose Edit .    In Rule # , enter a rule number (for example, 100). The rule\n                              \t\t\tnumber must not already be used in the network ACL. We process the rules in order,\n                              \t\t\tstarting with the lowest number.  Tip We recommend that you leave gaps between the rule numbers (such as 100, 200, 300),\n                                 rather than using sequential numbers (101, 102, 103). This makes it easier add a new\n                                 rule without having to renumber the existing rules.    Select a rule from the Type list. For example, to add a rule\n                              for HTTP, choose HTTP . To add a rule to allow all TCP traffic,\n                              choose All TCP . For some of these options (for example, HTTP), we\n                              fill in the port for you. To use a protocol that's not listed, choose Custom\n                                 Protocol Rule .    (Optional) If you're creating a custom protocol rule, select the protocol's\n                              number and name from the Protocol list. For more\n                              information, see IANA\n                                 List of Protocol Numbers .    (Optional) If the protocol you've selected requires a port number, enter the port\n                              number or\n                              port range separated by a hyphen (for example, 49152-65535).    In the Source or Destination field\n                              (depending on whether this is an inbound or outbound rule), enter the CIDR range that\n                              the rule applies to.    From the Allow/Deny list, select ALLOW to\n                              allow the specified traffic or DENY to deny the specified\n                              traffic.    (Optional) To add another rule, choose Add another rule , and\n                              repeat steps 4 to 9 as required.    When you are done, choose Save .   To delete a rule from a network ACL  Open the Amazon VPC console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/vpc/ .    In the navigation pane, choose Network ACLs , and then select\n                              the network ACL.    In the details pane, select either the Inbound Rules or Outbound Rules tab, and then choose Edit .\n                              Choose Remove for the rule you want to delete, and then choose Save .   Associating a Subnet with a Network ACL To apply the rules of a network ACL to a particular subnet, you must associate the\n                        subnet\n                        with the network ACL. You can associate a network ACL with multiple subnets; however,\n                        a subnet can be\n                        associated with only one network ACL. Any subnet not associated with a particular\n                        ACL is associated\n                        with the default network ACL by default. To associate a subnet with a network ACL  Open the Amazon VPC console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/vpc/ .    In the navigation pane, choose Network ACLs , and then select\n                              the network ACL.    In the details pane, on the Subnet Associations tab, choose Edit . Select the Associate check box for the\n                              subnet to associate with the network ACL, and then choose Save .   Disassociating a Network ACL from a Subnet You can disassociate a custom network ACL from a subnet — by doing so, the subnet\n                        is then automatically associated with the default network ACL. To disassociate a subnet from a network ACL  Open the Amazon VPC console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/vpc/ .    In the navigation pane, choose Network ACLs , and then select\n                              the network ACL.    In the details pane, choose the Subnet Associations tab.    Choose Edit , and then deselect the Associate check box for the subnet. Choose Save .   Changing a Subnet's Network ACL You can change the network ACL that's associated with a subnet. For example, when\n                        you\n                        create a subnet, it is initially associated with the default network ACL. You might\n                        want to\n                        instead associate it with a custom network ACL that you've created. After changing a subnet's network ACL, you don't have to terminate and relaunch the\n                        instances in\n                        the subnet; the changes take effect after a short period. To change a subnet's network ACL association  Open the Amazon VPC console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/vpc/ .    In the navigation pane, choose Subnets , and then select the\n                              subnet.    Choose the Network ACL tab, and then choose Edit .    Select the network ACL to associate the subnet with from the Change\n                                 to list, and then choose Save .   Deleting a Network ACL You can delete a network ACL only if there are no subnets associated with it. You\n                        can't\n                        delete the default network ACL. To delete a network ACL  Open the Amazon VPC console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/vpc/ .    In the navigation pane, choose Network ACLs .    Select the network ACL, and then choose Delete .    In the confirmation dialog box, choose Yes, Delete .   Example: Controlling Access to Instances in a Subnet In this example, instances in your subnet can communicate with each other, and are\n                        accessible from a trusted remote computer. The remote computer may be a computer in\n                        your local\n                        network or an instance in a different subnet or VPC that you use to connect to your\n                        instances\n                        to perform administrative tasks. Your security group rules and network ACL rules allow\n                        access\n                        from the IP address of your remote computer (172.31.1.2/32). All other traffic from\n                        the\n                        Internet or other networks is denied. All instances use the same security group (sg-1a2b3c4d), with the following rules. Inbound\n                                       Rules  Protocol Type  Protocol  Port Range  Source  Comments  All traffic  All  All  sg-1a2b3c4d  Enables instances associated with the same security group to communicate with\n                                    each other.  SSH  TCP  22  172.31.1.2/32  Allows inbound SSH access from the remote computer. If the instance is a Windows\n                                    computer, then this rule must use the RDP protocol for port 3389 instead.  Outbound\n                                       Rules  Protocol Type  Protocol  Port Range  Destination  Comments  All traffic  All  All  sg-1a2b3c4d  Enables instances associated with the same security group to communicate with\n                                    each other.  The subnet is associated with a network ACL that has the following rules. Inbound\n                                       Rules  Rule #  Type  Protocol  Port Range  Source  Allow/Deny  Comments  100  SSH  TCP  22  172.31.1.2/32  ALLOW  Allows inbound traffic from the remote computer. If the instance is a Windows\n                                    computer, then this rule must use the RDP protocol for port 3389 instead.  *  All traffic  All  All  0.0.0.0/0  DENY  Denies all other inbound traffic that does not match the previous rule.  Outbound\n                                       Rules  Rule #  Type  Protocol  Port Range  Destination  Allow/Deny  Comments  100  Custom TCP  TCP  1024-65535  172.31.1.2/32  ALLOW  Allows outbound responses to the remote computer. Network ACLs are stateless,\n                                    therefore this rule is required to allow response traffic for inbound\n                                    requests.  *  All traffic  All  All  0.0.0.0/0  DENY  Denies all other outbound traffic that does not match the previous rule.  This scenario gives you the flexibility to change the security groups or security\n                        group\n                        rules for your instances, and have the network ACL as the backup layer of defense.\n                        The network\n                        ACL rules apply to all instances in the subnet, so if you accidentally make your security\n                        group rules too permissive, the network ACL rules continue to permit access only from\n                        the\n                        single IP address. For example, the following rules are more permissive than the earlier\n                        rules\n                        — they allow inbound SSH access from any IP address. Inbound\n                                       Rules  Type  Protocol  Port Range  Source  Comments  All traffic  All  All  sg-1a2b3c4d  Enables instances associated with the same security group to communicate with\n                                    each other.  SSH  TCP  22  0.0.0.0/0  Allows SSH access from any IP address.  Outbound\n                                       Rules  Type  Protocol  Port Range  Destination  Comments  All  traffic  All  All  0.0.0.0/0  Allows all outbound traffic.  However, only other instances within the subnet and your remote computer are able\n                        to\n                        access this instance. The network ACL rules still prevent all inbound traffic to the\n                        subnet\n                        except from your remote computer.

The range\n                        varies\n                        depending on the client\'s operating system. Many Linux kernels (including the Amazon\n                        Linux kernel) use\n                        ports 32768-61000. Requests originating from Elastic Load Balancing use ports 1024-65535.\n                        Windows operating\n                        systems through Windows Server 2003 use ports 1025-5000. Windows Server 2008 and later\n                        versions use ports 49152-65535. A NAT gateway uses ports 1024-65535. For example,\n                        if a request\n                        comes into a web server in your VPC from a Windows XP client on the Internet, your\n                        network ACL\n                        must have an outbound rule to enable traffic destined for ports 1025-5000. \n                     </p><p>If an instance in your VPC is the client initiating a request, your network ACL must\n                        have\n                        an inbound rule to enable traffic destined for the ephemeral ports specific to the\n                        type of\n                        instance (Amazon Linux, Windows Server 2008, and so on). \n                     </p><p>In practice, to cover the different types of clients that might initiate traffic to\n                        public-facing instances in your VPC, you can open ephemeral ports 1024-65535.

This post aims to: describe the tooling available to load large data sets to DSE Graph  point out tips, tricks, and key learnings for bulk loading with DSE Graph Loader  provide code samples to simplify your bulk loading process into DSE Graph  Tooling DSE Graph Loader (DGL) is a powerful tool for loading graph data into DSE Graph. As shown in the marchitecture diagram below, the DGL supports multiple data input sources for bulk loading and provides high flexibility for manipulating data on ingest by requiring custom groovy data mapping scripts to map source data to graph objects. See the DataStax docs which cover the DGL, it\'s API, and DGL mapping scripts in detail. This article breaks down the tactics for efficient data loading with DGL into the following areas: file processing best practices  mapping script best practices  DGL configuration  Code and Tactics Code to accompany this section can be found at: https://github.com/phact/rundgl Shout out to Daniel Kuppitz, Pierre Laporte, Caroline George, Ulisses Beresi, Bryn Cooke among others who helped create and refine this framework. Any bugs / mistakes are mine. The code repository consists of: a wrapper bash script that is used for bookkeeping and calling DGL  a mapping script whith some helpful utilities and * a generic structure that can be used as a starting point for your own custom mapping scripts  a set of analysis scripts that can be used to monitor your load  The rest of this article will be focused on DGL loading best practices linking to specific code in the repo for clarity. File Bucketing The main consideration to take when loading large data volumes is that DGL performance will suffer if fed too much data in a single run. At the time of this article (2/28/2017), the DGL has features designed for non-idempotent graphs (including deduplication of vertices via an internal vertex cache) that limit its performance with large idempotent graphs. Splitting your loading files into chunks of about ~120Million or fewer vertices will ensure that the DGL does not lock up when the vertex cache is saturated. UPDATE: In modern versions of the graph loader, custom vertices are no longer cached. This means there should not be a performance impact of large files for this kind of load. Chunking may still be useful for percentage tracking / restarting / etc. The rundgl script found in the repo is designed to traverse a directory and bucket files, feeding them to DGL a bucket at a time to maximize performance. Track your progress The analysis directory in the rundgl repo contains a script called chart. This script will aggregate statistics from the DGL loader.log and generate throughput statistics and charts for the different loading phases that have occurred (Vertices, Edges, and Properties). Note - these scripts have only been tested with DGL < 5.0.6 Navigate to the analysis directory and run ./charts to get a dump of the throughput for your job: It will also start a simple http server in the directory for easy access to the png charts it generates, here is an example chart output: Thank you Pierre for building and sharing the analysis scripts Monitor DGL errors When the DGL gets timeouts from the server it does not log them to STDOUT, they can only be seen in logger.log. In a busy system, it is normal to see timeouts. These timeouts will be handled by retry policies which are baked into the loader. Too many timeouts may be a sign that you are overwhelming your cluster and need to either slow down (reduce threads in the loader) or scale out (add nodes in DSE). You will know if timeouts are affecting your cluster if your overall throughput starts trending down or if you are seeing backed up threadpools or dropped mutations in OpsCenter. Aside from Timeouts, you may also see errors in the DGL log that are caused by bad data or bugs in your mapping script. If enough of these errors happen the job will stop. To avoid having to restart from the beginning on data related issues, take a look at the bookeeping section below. Don\'t use S3 If you are looking to load significant amounts of data, do not use S3 as a source for performance reasons. It will take less time to parallel rsync your data from s3 to a local SSD and then load it than to load directly from s3. DGL does have S3 hooks and from a functionality perspective it works quite well (including aws authentication) so if you are not in a hurry, the repo also includes an example for pulling data from S3. Just be aware of the performance overhead. Groovy mapper best practices Custom groovy mapping scripts can be error prone and the DGL\'s error messages sometimes leave a bit to be desired. The framework provided aims to simplify the loading process by providing a standard framework for all your mapping scripts and minimizing the amount of logic that goes into the mapping scripts. Use the logger DGL mapping scripts can use the log4j logger to log messages. This can be very useful when troubleshooting issues in a load, especially issues that only show up at runtime with a particular file. It also allows you to track when particular loading events occur during execution. INFO, WARN, and ERROR messages will be logged to logger.log and will include a timestamp. DGL takes arguments If you need to pass an argument to the groovy mapper just pass it with - <argname> in the command line. The variable argname will be available in your mapping script. For example, ./rundgl passes -inputfilename to DGL here leveraging this feature. You can see the mapping script use it here . The argument inputfilename is a list of files to process to the DGL. This helps us avoid having to do complex directory traversals in the mapping script itself. By traversing files in the wrapper script, we are also able to do some bookeeping. Bookeeping loadedfiles.txt tracks the start and end of your job as well as the list of files that were loaded and when each particular load completed. This also enables us to "resume" progress by modifying the STARTBUCKET . STARTBUCKET represents the first bucket that will be processed by ./rundgl , if you stopped your job and want to continue where you left off, count the number of files in loadedfiles.txt and divide by the BUCKETSIZE , this will give you the bucket you were on. Starting from that bucket will ensure you don\'t miss any files. Since we are working with idempotent graphs, we don\'t have to worry about duplicates etc. DGL Vertex Cache Temp Directory Especially when using EBS, make sure to move the default directory of the DGL Vertex Cache temp directory. IO contention against the mapdb files used by DGL for its internal vertex cache will overwhelm amazon instances\' root EBS partitions Djava.io.tmpdir=/data/tmp If you are working on a graph schema that uses DSE Search indexes, you can optimize for overall load + indexing time by loading the data without the search indexes first and then creating the indexes once the data is in the system. Some screenshots Here are some screenshots from a system using this method to load billons of vertices. The spikes are each run of the DGL kicked off in sequence by the rundgl mapping script. You can see the load and performance are steady throughout the load giving us dependable throughput. Like with other DSE workloads, if you need more speed, scale out! Throughput: OS Load: Conclusion With the tooling, code, and tactics in this article you should be ready to load billions of V\'s, E\'s, and P\'s into DSE graph. The ./rundgl repo is there to help with error handling, logging, bookeeping, and file bucketing so that your loading experience is smooth. Enjoy!

Any bugs / mistakes are mine.</em></p><p>The code repository consists of:</p><ul><li>a wrapper bash script that is used for bookkeeping and calling DGL</li>\n<li>a mapping script whith some helpful utilities and * a generic structure that can be used as a starting point for your own custom mapping scripts</li>\n<li>a set of analysis scripts that can be used to monitor your load</li>\n</ul><p>The rest of this article will be focused on DGL loading best practices linking to specific code in the repo for clarity.</p><h4 id="filebucketing">File Bucketing</h4><p>The main consideration to take when loading large data volumes is that DGL performance will suffer if fed too much data in a single run. At the time of this article (2/28/2017), the DGL has features designed for non-idempotent graphs (including deduplication of vertices via an internal vertex cache) that limit its performance with large idempotent graphs.</p><p>Splitting your loading files into chunks of about ~120Million or fewer vertices will ensure that the DGL does not lock up when the vertex cache is saturated.</p></section><p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> In modern versions of the graph loader, custom vertices are no longer cached. This means there should not be a performance impact of large files for this kind of load. Chunking may still be useful for percentage tracking / restarting / etc.</p><section class="post-content">The rundgl script found in the repo is designed to traverse a directory and bucket files, feeding them to DGL a bucket at a time to maximize performance.<h4 id="trackyourprogress">Track your progress</h4><p>The analysis directory in the rundgl repo contains a script called chart. This script will aggregate statistics from the DGL loader.log and generate throughput statistics and charts for the different loading phases that have occurred (Vertices, Edges, and Properties).</p><p><strong><em>Note</em></strong><em>- these scripts have only been tested with DGL &lt; 5.0.6</em></p><p>Navigate to the analysis directory and run <code>./charts</code> to get a dump of the throughput for your job:</p><p><img src="https://www.datastax.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/dgl_results.png" alt="analysis" /></p><p>It will also start a simple http server in the directory for easy access to the png charts it generates, here is an example chart output:</p><p><img src="https://www.datastax.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/total-throughput.png" alt="total throughput" /></p><p><em>Thank you Pierre for building and sharing the analysis scripts</em></p><h4 id="monitordglerrors">Monitor DGL errors</h4><p>When the DGL gets timeouts from the server it does not log them to STDOUT, they can only be seen in logger.log. In a busy system, it is normal to see timeouts. These timeouts will be handled by retry policies which are baked into the loader. Too many timeouts may be a sign that you are overwhelming your cluster and need to either slow down (reduce threads in the loader) or scale out (add nodes in DSE). You will know if timeouts are affecting your cluster if your overall throughput starts trending down or if you are seeing backed up threadpools or dropped mutations in OpsCenter.</p><p>Aside from Timeouts, you may also see errors in the DGL log that are caused by bad data or bugs in your mapping script. If enough of these errors happen the job will stop. To avoid having to restart from the beginning on data related issues, take a look at the bookeeping section below.</p><h4 id="dontuses3">Don\'t use S3</h4><p>If you are looking to load significant amounts of data, do not use S3 as a source for performance reasons. It will take less time to parallel rsync your data from s3 to a local SSD and then load it than to load directly from s3.</p><p>DGL does have S3 hooks and from a functionality perspective it works quite well (including aws authentication) so if you are not in a hurry, the repo also includes an example for pulling data from S3. Just be aware of the performance overhead.</p><h4 id="groovymapperbestpractices">Groovy mapper best practices</h4><p>Custom groovy mapping scripts can be error prone and the DGL\'s error messages sometimes leave a bit to be desired. The framework provided aims to simplify the loading process by providing a standard framework for all your mapping scripts and minimizing the amount of logic that goes into the mapping scripts.</p><h4 id="usethelogger">Use the logger</h4><p>DGL mapping scripts can use the log4j logger to log messages. This can be very useful when troubleshooting issues in a load, especially issues that only show up at runtime with a particular file.</p><p>It also allows you to track when particular loading events occur during execution.</p><p>INFO, WARN, and ERROR messages will be logged to logger.log and will include a timestamp.</p><h4 id="dgltakesarguments">DGL takes arguments</h4><p>If you need to pass an argument to the groovy mapper just pass it with <code>- &lt;argname&gt;</code> in the command line.<br />The variable argname will be available in your mapping script.</p><p>For example, ./rundgl passes <code>-inputfilename</code> to DGL <a href="https://github.com/phact/rundgl/commit/6d008c86e98403c001c4164fcd8772ee9c2fa9bd#diff-ee4a3dcdb94cf3b56f6b0f191b4d4fd9R51">here</a> leveraging this feature. You can see the mapping script use it <a href="https://github.com/phact/rundgl/commit/6d008c86e98403c001c4164fcd8772ee9c2fa9bd#diff-46c8d2f865ad43987bc511d246a4b159R101">here</a>.</p><p>The argument <code>inputfilename</code> is a list of files to process to the DGL. This helps us avoid having to do complex directory traversals in the mapping script itself.</p><p>By traversing files in the wrapper script, we are also able to do some bookeeping.</p><h4 id="bookeeping">Bookeeping</h4><p><code>loadedfiles.txt</code> tracks the start and end of your job as well as the list of files that were loaded and when each particular load completed. This also enables us to "resume" progress by modifying the <code>STARTBUCKET</code>.</p><p><code>STARTBUCKET</code> represents the first bucket that will be processed by <code>./rundgl</code>, if you stopped your job and want to continue where you left off, count the number of files in <code>loadedfiles.txt</code> and divide by the <code>BUCKETSIZE</code>, this will give you the bucket you were on. Starting from that bucket will ensure you don\'t miss any files. Since we are working with idempotent graphs, we don\'t have to worry about duplicates etc.</p><h4 id="dglvertexcachetempdirectory">DGL Vertex Cache Temp Directory</h4><p>Especially when using EBS, make sure to move the default directory of the DGL Vertex Cache temp directory.</p><p>IO contention against the mapdb files used by DGL for its internal vertex cache will overwhelm amazon instances\' root EBS partitions</p><p><code>Djava.io.tmpdir=/data/tmp</code></p><p>If you are working on a graph schema that uses DSE Search indexes, you can optimize for overall load + indexing time by loading the data without the search indexes first and then creating the indexes once the data is in the system.</p><h3 id="somescreenshots">Some screenshots</h3><p>Here are some screenshots from a system using this method to load billons of vertices. The spikes are each run of the DGL kicked off in sequence by the rundgl mapping script. You can see the load and performance are steady throughout the load giving us dependable throughput.<br />Like with other DSE workloads, if you need more speed, scale out!</p><h4 id="throughput">Throughput:</h4><p><img src="https://www.datastax.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/long_throughput.png" alt="throughput" /></p><h4 id="osload">OS Load:</h4><p><img src="https://www.datastax.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/os-load.png" alt="osload" /></p><h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3><p>With the tooling, code, and tactics in this article you should be ready to load billions of V\'s, E\'s, and P\'s into DSE graph. The <code>./rundgl</code> repo is there to help with error handling, logging, bookeeping, and file bucketing so that your loading experience is smooth.
